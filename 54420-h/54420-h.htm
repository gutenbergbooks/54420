<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following work was announced several years ago in
the preface to the volume on “The Sidereal Heavens;”
since which time numerous enquiries have been made
after it by correspondents in England, the West Indies,
and America. It was nearly ready for publication three
years ago; but circumstances over which the Author
had no controul, prevented its appearance at that period.
This delay, however, has enabled him to introduce descriptions
of certain instruments and inventions which
were partly unknown at the time to which he refers.</p>

<p>The title “Practical Astronomer” has been fixed
upon, as the shortest that could be selected, although
the volume does not comprise a variety of topics and
discussions generally comprehended in this department
of astronomy. The work is intended for the information
of general readers, especially for those who have
acquired a relish for astronomical pursuits, and who
wish to become acquainted with the instruments by
which celestial observations are made, and to apply their
mechanical skill to the construction of some of those which
they may wish to possess. With this view the Author
has entered into a variety of minute details, in reference
to the construction and practical application of all kinds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
of telescopes, &amp;c. which are not to be found in general
treatises on Optics and Astronomy.</p>

<p>As <i>Light</i> is the foundation of astronomical science,
and of all the instruments used for celestial observation,
a brief description is given of the general properties of
light&mdash;of the laws by which it is refracted and reflected
when passing through different mediums&mdash;and of the
effects it produces in the system of nature&mdash;in order to
prepare the way for a clear understanding of the principles
on which optical instruments are constructed, and
the effects they produce.</p>

<p>As this, as well as every other physical subject, forms
a part of the arrangements of the Creator throughout
the material system&mdash;the Author has occasionally taken
an opportunity of directing the attention of the reader
to the Wisdom and Beneficence of the Great First
Cause, and of introducing those moral reflections which
naturally flow from the subject.</p>

<p>The present is the ninth volume which the Author has
presented to the public, and he indulges the hope that
it will meet with the same favourable reception which
his former publications have uniformly experienced.
It was originally intended to conclude the volume with a
few remarks on the <i>utility</i> of astronomical studies, and
their <i>moral</i> and <i>religious</i> tendency, but this has been
prevented, for the present, in consequence of the work
having swelled to a greater size than was anticipated.
Should he again appear before the public as an author,
the subject of discussion and illustration will have a
more direct bearing than the present on the great
objects of religion and a future world.</p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Light is that invisible etherial matter which
renders objects perceptible by the visual organs.
It appears to be distributed throughout the immensity
of the universe, and is essentially requisite
to the enjoyment of every rank of perceptive
existence. It is by the agency of this mysterious
substance, that we become acquainted with the
beauties and sublimities of the universe, and the
wonderful operations of the Almighty Creator.
Without its universal influence, an impenetrable
veil would be thrown over the distant scenes of
creation; the sun, the moon, the planets, and the
starry orbs, would be shrouded in the deepest
darkness, and the variegated surface of the globe
on which we dwell, would be almost unnoticed
and unknown. Creation would disappear, a mysterious
gloom would surround the mind of every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
intelligence, all around would appear a dismal
waste, and an undistinguished chaos. To whatever
quarter we might turn, no form nor comeliness
would be seen, and scarcely a trace of the
perfections and agency of an All Wise and
Almighty Being could be perceived throughout
the universal gloom. In short, without the influence
of light, no world could be inhabited, no
animated being could subsist in the manner it now
does, no knowledge could be acquired of the
works of God, and happiness, even in the lowest
degree, could scarcely be enjoyed by any organized
intelligence.</p>

<p>We have never yet known what it is to live in
a world deprived of this delightful visitant; for
in the darkest night we enjoy a share of its beneficial
agency, and even in the deepest dungeon its
influence is not altogether unfelt.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The blind,
indeed, do not directly enjoy the advantages of
light, but its influence is reflected upon them, and
their knowledge is promoted through the medium
of those who enjoy the use of their visual organs.
Were all the inhabitants of the world deprived of
their eye-sight, neither knowledge nor happiness,
such as we now possess, could possibly be enjoyed.</p>

<p>There is nothing which so strikingly displays the
beneficial and enlivening effects of light, as the
dawn of a mild morning after a night of darkness
and tempest. All appears gloom and desolation,
in our terrestrial abode, till a faint light begins to
whiten the eastern horizon. Every succeeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
moment brings along with it something new and
enlivening. The crescent of light towards the
east, now expands its dimensions and rises upwards
towards the cope of heaven; and objects,
which a little before were immersed in the deepest
gloom, begin to be clearly distinguished. At
length the sun arises, and all nature is animated
by his appearance; the magnificent scene of
creation, which a little before was involved in obscurity,
opens gradually to view, and every object
around excites sentiments of wonder, delight, and
adoration. The radiance which emanates from
this luminary, displays before us a world strewed
with blessings and embellished with the most
beautiful attire. It unveils the lofty mountains
and the forests with which they are crowned&mdash;the
fruitful fields with the crops that cover them&mdash;the
meadows, with the rivers which water and
refresh them&mdash;the plains adorned with verdure,
the placid lake and the expansive ocean. It
removes the curtain of darkness from the abodes
of men, and shows us the cities, towns and villages,
the lofty domes, the glittering spires, and
the palaces and temples with which the landscape
is adorned. The flowers expand their buds and
put forth their colours, the birds awake to melody,
man goes forth to his labour, the sounds of human
voices are heard, and all appears life and activity,
as if a new world had emerged from the darkness
of Chaos.</p>

<p>The whole of this splendid scene, which light
produces, may be considered as a new creation,
no less grand and beneficent than the first creation,
when the command was issued, “Let there be
light, and light was.” The aurora and the rising
sun cause the earth and all the objects which
adorn its surface, to arise out of that profound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
darkness and apparent desolation which deprived
us of the view of them, as if they had been no
more. It may be affirmed, in full accordance with
truth, that the efflux of light in the dawn of the
morning, after a dark and cloudy night, is even
more magnificent and exhilarating than at the first
moment of its creation. At that period, there
were no spectators on earth to admire its glorious
effects; and no objects, such as we now behold,
to be embellished with its radiance. The earth
was a shapeless chaos, where no beauty or order
could be perceived; the mountains had not reared
their heads; the seas were not collected into their
channels; no rivers rolled through the valleys, no
verdure adorned the plains; the atmosphere was
not raised on high to reflect the radiance, and no
animated beings existed to diversify and enliven
the scene. But now, when the dawning of the
morning scatters the darkness of the night, it
opens to view a scene of beauty and magnificence.
The heavens are adorned with azure, the clouds
are tinged with the most lively colours, the mountains
and plains are clothed with verdure, and the
whole of this lower creation stands forth arrayed
with diversified scenes of beneficence and grandeur,
while the contemplative eye looks round and
wonders.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the important and beneficent
effects of that <i>light</i> which every moment diffuses
its blessings around us. It may justly be considered
as one of the most essential substances connected
with the system of the material universe,
and which gives efficiency to all the other principles
and arrangements of nature. Hence we are
informed, in the sacred history, that light was the
first production of the Almighty Creator, and the
first born of created beings; for without it the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
universe would have presented nothing but an
immense blank to all sentient existences. Hence,
likewise, the Divine Being is metaphorically represented
under the idea of light, as being the
source of knowledge and felicity to all subordinate
intelligences: “God is <i>light</i>, and in Him is no
darkness at all;” and he is exhibited as “dwelling
in light unapproachable and full of glory, whom
no man hath seen or can see.” In allusion to
these circumstances, Milton, in his Paradise Lost,
introduces the following beautiful apostrophe:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Hail holy light! offspring of heaven first born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or of the eternal co-eternal beam!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never but in unapproached light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dwelt from eternity; dwelt then in thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright effluence of bright essence increate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">----Before the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God, as with a mantle, did’st invest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising world of waters dark and deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won from the void and formless infinite.’<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As light is an element of so much importance
and utility in the system of nature, so we find
that arrangements have been made for its universal
diffusion throughout all the worlds in the universe.
The sun is one of the principal sources of light
to this earth on which we dwell, and to all the
other planetary bodies. And, in order that it
may be <i>equally</i> distributed over every portion of
the surfaces of these globes, to suit the exigencies
of their inhabitants, they are endowed with a
motion of rotation, by which every part of their
surfaces is alternately turned towards the source of
light; and when one hemisphere is deprived of
the direct influence of the solar rays, its inhabitants
derive a portion of light from luminaries
in more distant regions, and have their views
directed to other suns and systems dispersed, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
countless numbers, throughout the remote spaces
of the universe. Around several of the planets,
satellites, or moons, have been arranged for the
purpose of throwing light on their surfaces in the
absence of the sun, while at the same time the
primary planets themselves reflect an effulgence of
light upon their satellites. All the stars which
our unassisted vision can discern in the midnight
sky, and the millions more which the telescope
alone enables us to descry, must be considered as
so many fountains of light, not merely to illuminate
the voids of immensity, but to irradiate with
their beams surrounding worlds with which they
are more immediately connected, and to diffuse a
general lustre throughout the amplitudes of infinite
space. And, therefore, we have every reason
to believe, that, could we fly, for thousands of
years, with the swiftness of a seraph, through the
spaces of immensity, we should never approach
a region of absolute darkness, but should find ourselves,
every moment encompassed with the emanations
of light, and cheered with its benign influences.
That Almighty Being who inhabiteth
immensity and “dwells in light inaccessible,”
evidently appears to have diffused light over the
remotest spaces of his creation, and to have thrown
a radiance upon all the provinces of his wide and
eternal empire, so that every intellectual being,
wherever existing, may feel its beneficent effects,
and be enabled, through its agency, to trace his
wonderful operations, and the glorious attributes
with which he is invested.</p>

<p>As the science of astronomy depends solely on
the influence of light upon the organ of vision,
which is the most noble and extensive of all our
senses; and as the construction of telescopes and
other astronomical instruments is founded upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
our knowledge of the nature of light and the laws
by which it operates&mdash;it is essentially requisite,
before proceeding to a description of such instruments,
to take a cursory view of its nature and
properties, in so far as they have been ascertained,
and the effects it produces when obstructed by
certain bodies, or when passing through different
mediums.

<h4 id="GENERAL_PROPERTIES_OF_LIGHT">GENERAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>It is not my intention to discuss the subject of
light in minute detail&mdash;a subject which is of considerable
extent, and which would require a
separate treatise to illustrate it in all its aspects
and bearings. All that I propose is to offer a
few illustrations of its general properties, and the
laws by which it is refracted and reflected, so as
to prepare the way for explaining the nature and
construction of telescopes, and other optical instruments.</p>

<p>There is no branch of natural science more
deserving of our study and investigation than that
which relates to light&mdash;whether we consider its
beautiful and extensive effects&mdash;the magnificence
and grandeur of the objects it unfolds to view&mdash;the
numerous and diversified phenomena it exhibits&mdash;the
optical instruments which a knowledge
of its properties has enabled us to construct&mdash;or
the daily advantages we derive, as social beings,
from its universal diffusion. If air, which serves
as the medium of sound, and the vehicle of speech,
enables us to carry on an interchange of thought
and affection with our fellow-men; how much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
more extensively is that intercourse increased by
light, which presents the images of our friends
and other objects as it were immediately before us,
in all their interesting forms and aspects&mdash;the
speaking eye&mdash;the rosy cheeks&mdash;the benevolent
smile, and the intellectual forehead! The eye,
more susceptible of multifarious impressions than
the other senses, ‘takes in at once the landscape
of the world,’ and enables us to distinguish, in a
moment, the shapes and forms of all its objects,
their relative positions, the colours that adorn
them, their diversified aspect, and the motions
by which they are transported from one portion
of space to another. Light, through the medium
of the eye, not only unfolds to us the persons of
others, in all their minute modifications and peculiarities,
but exhibits us to ourselves. It presents
to our own vision a faithful portrait of our peculiar
features behind reflecting substances, without
which property we should remain entirely ignorant
of those traits of countenance which characterize
us in the eyes of others.</p>

<p>But, what is the nature of this substance we
call <i>light</i>, which thus unfolds to us the scenes of
creation? On this subject two leading opinions
have prevailed in the philosophical world. One
of those opinions is, that the whole sphere of the
universe is filled with a subtle matter, which
receives from luminous bodies an agitation which
is incessantly continued, and which, by its vibratory
motion, enables us to perceive luminous
bodies. According to this opinion, light may be
considered as analogous to sound, which is conveyed
to the ear by the vibratory motions of the air.
This was the hypothesis of Descartes, which was
adopted, with some modifications, by the celebrated
Euler, Huygens, Franklin, and other philosophers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
and has been admitted by several scientific
gentlemen of the present day. The other
opinion is, that light consists of the emission or
emanation of the particles of luminous bodies,
thrown out incessantly on all sides, in consequence
of the continued agitation it experiences. This
is the hypothesis of the illustrious Newton, and
has been most generally adopted by British
philosophers.</p>

<p>To the first hypothesis, it is objected that, if
true, ‘light would not only spread itself in a
direct line, but its motion would be transmitted
in every direction like that of sound, and would
convey the impression of luminous bodies in the
regions of space beyond the obstacles that intervene
to stop its progress.’ No wall or other
opaque body could obstruct its course, if it undulated
in every direction like sound; and it would
be a necessary consequence, that we should have
no night, nor any such phenomena as eclipses of
the sun or moon, or of the satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn. This objection has never been very
satisfactorily answered. On the other hand,
Euler brings forward the following objections
against the Newtonian doctrine of emanation.
1. That, were the sun emitting continually, and
in all directions, such floods of luminous matter
with a velocity so prodigious, he must speedily be
exhausted, or at least, some alteration must, after
the lapse of so many ages, be perceptible. 2. That
the sun is not the only body that emits rays, but
that all the stars have the same quality; and as
every where the rays of the sun must be crossing
the rays of the stars, their collision must be violent
in the extreme, and that their direction must
be changed by such a collision.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>To the first of these objections it is answered&mdash;that
so vast is the tenuity of light, that it utterly
exceeds the power of conception: the most delicate
instrument having never been certainly put
in motion by the impulse of the accumulated sun-beams.
It has been calculated that in the space
of 385,130,000 Egyptian years, (of 360 days,)
the sun would lose only the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,217,420th</sub> of his bulk
from the continual efflux of his light. And,
therefore, if in 385 <i>millions</i> of years the sun’s
diminution would be so extremely small, it would
be altogether insensible during the comparatively
short period of five or six thousand years. To
the second objection it is replied&mdash;that the particles
of light are so extremely rare that their distance
from one another is incomparably greater than
their diameters&mdash;that all objections of this kind
vanish when we attend to the continuation of the
impression upon the retina, and to the small
number of luminous particles which are on that
account necessary for producing constant vision.
For it appears, from the accurate experiments of
M. D’Arcy, that the impression of light upon the
retina continues <i>eight thirds</i>, and as a particle of
light would move through 26,000 miles in that
time, constant vision would be maintained by a
succession of luminous particles twenty-six thousand
miles distant from each other.</p>

<p>Without attempting to decide on the merits of
these two hypotheses, I shall leave the reader to
adopt that opinion which he may judge to be
attended with the fewest difficulties, and proceed
to illustrate some of the <i>properties of light</i>:&mdash;and
in the discussion of this subject, I shall
generally adhere to the terms employed by those
who have adopted the hypothesis of the <i>emanation</i>
of light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Light emanates or radiates from luminous
bodies in a straight line.</i> This property is proved
by the impossibility of seeing light through bent
tubes, or small holes pierced in metallic plates
placed one behind another, except the holes be
placed in a straight line. If we endeavour to look
at the sun or a candle through the bore of a
bended pipe, we cannot perceive the object, nor
any light proceeding from it, but through a
straight pipe the object may be perceived. This
is likewise evident from the form of the rays of
light that penetrate a dark room, which proceed
straight forward in lines proceeding from the
luminous body; and from the form of the <i>shadows</i>
which bodies project, which are bounded by right
lines passing from the luminous body, and meeting
the lines which terminate the interposing
body. This property may be demonstrated to
the eye, by causing light to pass through small
holes into a dark room filled with smoke or dust.
It is to be understood, however, that in this case,
the rays of light are considered as passing through
the same medium; for when they pass from air
into water, glass, or other media, they are bent
at the point where they enter a different medium,
as we shall afterwards have occasion to explain.</p>

<p>2. <i>Light moves with amazing velocity.</i> The
ancients believed that it was propagated from the
sun and other luminous bodies <i>instantaneously</i>;
but the observations of modern astronomers have
demonstrated that this is an erroneous hypothesis,
and that light, like other projectiles, occupies a
certain time in passing from one part of space to
another. Its velocity, however, is prodigious,
and exceeds that of any other body with which
we are acquainted. It flies across the earth’s orbit&mdash;a
space 190 millions of miles in extent, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
course of sixteen and a half minutes, which is at
the rate of 192,000 miles every second, and more
than a million of times swifter than a cannon ball
flying with its greatest velocity. It appears from
the discoveries of Dr. Bradley, respecting the
aberration of the stars, that light flies from those
bodies, with a velocity similar, if not exactly the
same; so that the light of the sun, the planets,
the stars, and every luminous body in the universe
is propagated with <i>uniform</i> velocity.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> But, if the
velocity of light be so very great, it may be asked,
how does it not strike against all objects with a
force equal to its velocity? If the finest sand
were thrown against our bodies with the hundredth
part of this velocity, each grain would
pierce us as certainly as the sharpest and swiftest
arrows from a bow. It is a principle in mechanics
that the force with which all bodies strike, is in
proportion to the size of these bodies, or the
quantity of matter they contain, multiplied by the
velocity with which they move. Therefore if the
particles of light were not almost infinitely small,
they would, of necessity prove destructive in the
highest degree. If a particle of light were equal
in size to the twelve hundred thousandth part of
a small grain of sand,&mdash;supposing light to be
material&mdash;we should be no more able to withstand
its force than we should that of sand shot point
blank from the mouth of a cannon. Every object
would be battered and perforated by such celestial
artillery, till our world were laid in ruins, and
every living being destroyed. And herein are the
wisdom and benevolence of the Creator displayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
in making the particles of light so extremely small
as to render them in some degree proportionate to
the greatness of the force with which they are
impelled; otherwise, all nature would have been
thrown into ruin and confusion, and the great
globes of the universe shattered to atoms.</p>

<p>We have many proofs, besides the above, that
the particles of light are next to infinitely small.
We find that they penetrate with facility the
hardest substances, such as crystal, glass, various
kinds of precious stones, and even the diamond
itself, though among the hardest of stones; for
such bodies could not be transparent, unless light
found an easy passage through their pores.
When a candle is lighted in an elevated situation,
in the space of a second or two, it will fill a cubical
space (if there be no interruption) of two miles
around it, in every direction, with luminous particles,
before the least sensible part of its substance
is lost by the candle:&mdash;that is, it will in a short
instant, fill a sphere four miles in diameter, twelve
and a half miles in circumference, and containing
thirty-three and a half cubical miles with particles
of light; for an eye placed in any part of this
cubical space would perceive the light emitted by
the candle. It has been calculated that the number
of particles of light contained in such a space
cannot be less than <i>four hundred septillions</i>&mdash;a number
which is <i>six billions</i> of times greater than the
number of grains of sand which could be contained
in the whole earth considered as a solid globe,
and supposing each cubic inch of it to contain ten
hundred thousand grains. Such is the inconceivable
tenuity of that substance which emanates
from all luminous bodies, and which gives beauty
and splendour to the universe! This may also be
evinced by the following experiment. Make a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
small pin-hole in a piece of black paper, and hold
the paper upright facing a row of candles placed
near each other, and at a little distance behind
the black paper, place a piece of white pasteboard.
On this pasteboard the rays which flow
from all the candles through the small hole in
the black paper, will form as many specks of light
as there are candles, each speck being as clear
and distinct as if there were only one speck from
a single candle. This experiment shows that
the streams of light from the different candles pass
through the small hole without confusion, and
consequently, that the particles of light are exceedingly
small. For the same reason we can
easily see through a small hole not more than
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of an inch in diameter, the sky, the trees,
houses, and nearly all the objects in an extensive
landscape, occupying nearly an entire hemisphere,
the light of all which may pass through this small
aperture.</p>

<p>3. <i>Light is sent forth in all directions from every
visible point of luminous bodies.</i> If we hold a
sheet of paper before a candle, or the sun, or any
other source of light, we shall find that the paper
is illuminated in whatever position we hold it,
provided the light is not obstructed by its edge or
by any other body. Hence, wherever a spectator
is placed with regard to a luminous body, every
point of that part of its surface which is toward
him will be visible, when no intervening object
intercepts the passage of the light. Hence, likewise,
it follows, that the sun illuminates, not
only an immense plane extending along the paths
of the planets, from the one side of the orbit of
Uranus to the other, but the whole of that sphere,
or solid space, of which the distance of Uranus is
the radius. The diameter of this sphere is three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
thousand six hundred <i>millions</i> of miles, and it,
consequently, contains about 24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
or twenty-four thousand
<i>quartillions</i> of cubical miles,&mdash;every point of which
immense space is filled with the solar beams. Not
only so, but the whole cubical space which intervenes
between the sun and the nearest fixed stars is more
or less illuminated by his rays. For, at the distance
of Sirius, or any other of the nearest stars,
the sun would be visible, though only as a small
twinkling orb; and consequently, his rays must
be diffused, however faint, throughout the most
distant spaces whence he is visible. The diameter
of this immense sphere of light cannot be less than
<i>forty billions</i> of miles, and its solid contents 33,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
or, thirty-three thousand, five hundred
<i>sextillions</i> of cubical miles. All this immense,
and incomprehensible space is filled with the
radiations of the solar orb; for were an eye
placed in any one point of it, where no extraneous
body interposed, the sun would be visible either
as a large luminous orb, or as a small twinkling
star. But he can be visible only by the rays he
emits, and which enter the organs of vision.
How inconceivably immense, then, must be the
quantity of rays which are thrown off in all directions
from that luminary which is the source of
our day! Every star must likewise be considered
as emitting innumerable streams of radiance over
a space equally extensive, so that no point in the
universe can be conceived where absolute darkness
prevails, unless in the <i>interior</i> regions of planetary
bodies.</p>

<p>4. <i>The effect of light upon the eye is not instantaneous,
but continues for a short space of time.</i>
This may be proved and illustrated by the following
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
examples:&mdash;If a stick&mdash;or a ball connected
with a string&mdash;be whirled round in a circle, and
a certain degree of velocity given it, the object
will appear to fill the whole circle it describes. If
a lighted firebrand be whirled round in the same
rapid manner, a complete circle of light will be
exhibited. This experiment obviously shows
that the impression made on the eye by the light
from the ball or the firebrand&mdash;when in any given
point of the circle&mdash;is sufficiently lasting to remain
till it has described the whole circle, and
again renews its effect, as often as the circular
motion is continued. The same is proved by the
following considerations:&mdash;We are continually
shutting our eyes, <i>or winking</i>; and, during the
time our eyes are shut, on such occasions, we
should lose the view of surrounding objects, if the
impression of light did not continue a certain time
while the eye-lid covers the pupil; but experience
proves that during such vibrations of the eye-lids,
the light from surrounding objects is not sensibly
intercepted. If we look for some time steadily at
the light of a candle, and particularly, if we look
directly at the sun, without any interposing
medium, or if we look for any considerable time
at this luminary, through a telescope with a
coloured glass interposed&mdash;in all these cases, if we
shut our eyes immediately after viewing such
objects, we shall still perceive a faint image of the
object, by the impression which its light has made
upon our eyes.</p>

<p>‘With respect to the <i>duration</i> of the impression
of light, it has been observed that the teeth of a
cog-wheel in a clock were still visible in succession,
when the velocity of rotation brought 246 teeth
through a given fixed point in a second. In this
case it is clear that if the impression made on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
eye by the light reflected from any tooth, had
lasted without sensible diminution for the 246th
part of a second, the teeth would have formed
one unbroken line, because a new tooth would
have continually arrived in the place of the interior
one before its image could have disappeared.
If a live coal be whirled round, it is observed that
the luminous circle is complete, when the rotation
is performed in the (8&frac12;)/60th of a second. In this
instance we see that the impression was much
more durable than the former. Lastly, if an
observer sitting in a room direct his sight through
a window, to any particular object out of doors,
for about half a minute, and then shut his eyes
and cover them with his hands, he will still continue
to see the window, together with the outline
of the terrestrial objects bordering on the
sky. This appearance will remain for near a
minute, though occasionally vanishing and changing
colour in a manner that brevity forbids our
minutely describing. From these facts we are
authorized to conclude, that all impressions of
light on the eye, last a considerable time, that
the brightest objects make the most lasting impressions;
and that, if the object be very bright,
or the eye weak, the impression may remain for
a time so strong, as to mix with and confuse the
subsequent impressions made by other objects.
In the last case the eye is said to be <i>dazzled</i> by
the light.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The following experiment has likewise been suggested
as a proof of the impression which light makes
upon the eye. If a card, on both sides of which a
figure is drawn, for example, a bird and a cage, be
made to revolve rapidly on the straight line which
divides it symmetrically, the eye will perceive both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
figures at the same time, provided they return
successively to the same place. M. D’Arcy found
by various experiments, that, in general, the impression
which light produces on the eye, lasts
about <i>the eighth of a second</i>. M. Plateau, of
Brussels, found that the impression of different
colours lasted the following periods; the numbers
here stated being the decimal parts of a <i>second</i>.
<i>Flame</i>, 0.242. or nearly one fourth of a second;
<i>Burning coal</i>, 0.229; <i>White</i>, 0.182, or, a little
more than one sixth of a second; <i>Blue</i>, 0.186;
<i>Yellow</i>, 0.173; <i>Red</i>, 0.184.</p>

<p>5. <i>Light</i>, though extremely minute, <i>is supposed
to have a certain degree of force or momentum</i>.
In order to prove this, the late ingenious Mr.
Mitchell contrived the following experiment. He
constructed a small vane in the form of a common
weather-cock, of a <i>very thin</i> plate of copper,
about an inch square, and attached to one of the
finest harpsicord wires, about ten inches long,
and nicely balanced at the other end of the wire,
by a grain of very small shot. The instrument had
also fixed to it in the middle, at right angles to
the length of the wire, and in an horizontal direction,
a small bit of a very slender sewing
needle, about half an inch long, which was made
magnetical. In this state the whole instrument
might weigh about ten grains. The vane was
supported in the manner of the needle in the
mariner’s compass, so that it could turn with the
greatest ease; and to prevent its being affected
by the vibrations of the air, it was enclosed in a
glass case or box. The rays of the sun were then
thrown upon the broad part of the vane or copper
plate, from a concave mirror of about two feet
diameter, which, passing through the front glass
of the box, were collected into the focus of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
mirror upon the copper plate. In consequence
of this the plate began to move with a slow
motion of about an inch in a second of time, till
it had moved through a space of about two inches
and a half, when it struck against the back of the
box. The mirror being removed, the instrument
returned to its former situation, and the rays of
the sun being again thrown upon it, it again began
to move, and struck against the back of the box
as before. This was repeated three or four times
with the same success.</p>

<p>On the above experiment, the following calculation
has been founded: If we impute the
motion produced in this experiment to the impulse
of the rays of light, and suppose that the
instrument weighed ten grains, and acquired a
velocity of one inch in a second, we shall find that
the quantity of matter contained in the rays falling
upon the instrument in that time amounted
to no more than one twelve hundred-millionth
part of a grain, the velocity of light exceeding
the velocity of one inch in a second in the proportion
of about 12,000,000,000 to 1. The light
in this experiment was collected from a surface of
about three square feet, which reflecting only
about half what falls upon it, the quantity of
matter contained in the rays of the sun incident
upon a foot and a half of surface in one second
of time, ought to be no more than the twelve
hundred-millionth part of a grain. But the density
of the rays of light at the surface of the sun
is greater than that at the earth in the proportion
of 45,000 to 1; there ought therefore to issue
from one square foot of the sun’s surface in one
second of time, in order to supply the waste by
light <sup>1</sup>/<sub>45,000th</sub> part of a grain of matter, that is,
a little more than two grains a day, or about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
4,752,000  grains, or 670 pounds avoirdupoise,
nearly, in 6,000 years, a quantity which would
have shortened the sun’s diameter no more than
about ten feet, if it were formed of the density of
water only.</p>

<p>If the above experiment be considered as having
been accurately performed, and if the calculations
founded upon it be correct, it appears that
there can be no grounds for apprehension that
the sun can ever be sensibly diminished by the
immense and incessant radiations proceeding from
his body on the supposition that light is a material
emanation. For the diameter of the sun is
no less than 880,000 miles; and, before this diameter
could be shortened, by the emission of
light, one English mile, it would require three
millions, one hundred and sixty-eight thousand
years, at the rate now stated; and, before it could
be shortened ten miles, it would require a period
of above thirty-one millions of years. And
although the sun were thus actually diminished,
it would produce no sensible effect or derangement
throughout the planetary system. We have
no reason to believe that the system, <i>in its present
state and arrangements</i>, was intended to endure
for ever, and before that luminary could be so far
reduced, during the revolutions of eternity, as to
produce any irregularities in the system, new
arrangements and modifications might be introduced
by the hand of the All Wise and Omnipotent
Creator. Besides, it is not improbable that a
system of means is established by which the sun
and all the luminaries in the universe receive back
again a portion of the light which they are continually
emitting, either from the planets from
whose surfaces it is reflected, or from the millions
of stars whose rays are continually traversing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
immense spaces of creation, or from some other
sources to us unknown.</p>

<p>6. <i>The intensity of light is diminished in proportion
to the square of the distance from the luminous
body.</i> Thus, a person at two feet distance
from a candle, has only the fourth part of the
light he would have at one foot, at three feet distance
the ninth part, at four feet the sixteenth
part, at five feet the twenty fifth part, and so on
for other distances. Hence the light received by
the planets of the Solar system decreases in proportion
to the squares of the distances of these
bodies from the sun. This may be illustrated by
the following figure,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>Figure 1.</i></p>
<img id="fig001" src="images/fig001.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Suppose the light which flows from a point
A, and passes through a square hole B, is received
upon a plane C, parallel to the plane of
the hole&mdash;or, let the figure C be considered as
the shadow of the plane B. When the distance
of C is double of B, the length and breadth of
the shadow C will be each double of the length
and breadth of the plane B, and treble when AD
is treble of AB, and so on, which may be easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
examined by the light of a candle placed at A.
Therefore the surface of the shadow C, at the distance
AC&mdash;double of AB, is divisible into four
squares, and at a treble distance, into nine
squares, severally equal to the square B, as represented
in the figure. The light, then, which falls
upon the plane B being suffered to pass to double
that distance, will be uniformly spread over four
times the space, and consequently will be four
times thinner in every part of that space. And
at a treble distance it will be nine times thinner,
and at a quadruple distance sixteen times thinner
than it was at first. Consequently the quantities
of this rarified light received upon a surface of
any given size and shape when removed successively
to these several distances, will be but one-fourth,
one-ninth, one-sixteenth, of the whole quantity
received by it at the first distance AB.</p>

<p>In conformity with this law, the relative quantities
of light on the surfaces of the planets may
be easily determined, when their distances from
the sun are known. Thus, the distance of Uranus
from the sun is 1,800,000,000 miles, which is about
nineteen times greater than the distance of the
earth from the same luminary. The square of 19
is 361; consequently the earth enjoys 361 times
the intensity of light when compared with that of
Uranus; in other words, this distant planet
enjoys only the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>361</sub> part of the quantity of light
which falls upon the earth. This quantity, however,
is equivalent to the light we should enjoy
from the combined effulgence of 348 full moons;
and if the pupils of the eyes of the inhabitants
of this planet be much larger than ours, and the
<i>retina</i> of the eye be endued with a much greater
degree of nervous sensibility, they may perceive
objects with as great a degree of splendour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
as we perceive on the objects which surround
us in this world. Following out the same
principle, we find that the quantity of light enjoyed
by the planet Mercury is nearly <i>seven</i>
times greater than that of the Earth, and that of
Venus nearly <i>double</i> of what we enjoy&mdash;that Mars
has less than the one half&mdash;Jupiter the <i>one twenty-seventh</i>
part&mdash;and Saturn only the <i>one ninetieth</i>
part of the light which falls upon the Earth.
That the light of these distant planets, however,
is not so weak as we might at first imagine appears
from the brilliancy they exhibit, when viewed in
our nocturnal sky, either with the telescope or
with the unassisted eye&mdash;and likewise from the
circumstance that a very small portion of the Sun&mdash;such
as the one fortieth or one fiftieth part
diffuses a quantity of light sufficient for most of the
purposes of life, as is found in the case of total
eclipses of the Sun, when his western limb begins
to be visible, only like a fine luminous thread, for
his light is then sufficient to render distinctly
visible all the parts of the surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>7. <i>It is by light reflected from opake bodies
that most of the objects around us are rendered
visible.</i> When a lighted candle is brought into a
dark room, not only the candle but all other
bodies in the room become visible. Rays of the
sun passing into a dark room render luminous a
sheet of paper on which they fall, and this sheet
in its turn enlightens, to a certain extent, the
whole apartment, and renders objects in it visible,
so long as it receives the rays of the sun. In like
manner, the moon and the planets are opake
bodies, but the light of the sun falling upon them,
and being reflected from their surfaces, renders
them visible. Were no light to fall on them from
the sun, or were they not endued with a power of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
reflecting it, they would be altogether invisible to
our sight. When the moon comes between us
and the sun, as in a total eclipse of that luminary,
as no solar light is reflected from the surface next
the earth, she is invisible&mdash;only the curve or outline
of her figure being distinguished by her shadow.
In this case, however, there is a certain
portion of reflected light on the lunar hemisphere
next the earth, though not distinguishable during
a solar eclipse. The earth is enlightened by the
sun, and a portion of the rays which fall upon it is
reflected upon the dark hemisphere of the moon
which is then towards the earth. This reflected
light from the earth is distinctly perceptible, when
the moon appears as a slender crescent, two or
three days after new moon&mdash;when the earth reflects
its light back on the moon, in the same
manner as the full moon reflects her light on the
earth. Hence, even at this period of the moon,
her whole face becomes visible to us, but its light
is not uniform or of equal intensity. The thin
crescent on which the full blaze of the solar light
falls, is very brilliant and distinctly seen, while the
other part, on which falls only a comparatively
feeble light from the earth, appears very faint, and
is little more than visible to the naked eye, but
with a telescope of moderate power,&mdash;if the atmosphere
be very clear&mdash;it appears beautifully distinct,
so that the relative positions of many of the lunar
spots may be distinguished.</p>

<p>The intensity of reflected light is very small,
when compared with that which proceeds directly
from luminous bodies. M. Bouguer, a French
philosopher, who made a variety of experiments to
ascertain the proportion of light emitted by the
heavenly bodies, concluded from these experiments,
that the light transmitted from the sun to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the earth is at least 300,000 times as great
as that which descends to us from the full moon&mdash;and
that, of 300,000 rays which the moon receives,
from 170,000 to 200,000 are absorbed. Hence
we find that, however brilliant the moon may
appear at night&mdash;in the day time she appears as
obscure as a small portion of dusky cloud to which
she happens to be adjacent, and reflects no more
light than a portion of whitish cloud of the same
size. And as the full moon fills only the ninety
thousandth part of the sky, it would require at
least ninety thousand moons to produce as much
light as we enjoy in the day-time under a cloudy
sky.</p>

<p>As the moon and the planets are rendered visible
to us only by light reflected from their surfaces,
so it is in the same way that the images of most
of the objects around us are conveyed to our
organs of vision. We behold all the objects which
compose an extensive landscape,&mdash;the hills and
vales, the woods and lawns, the lakes and rivers,
and the habitations of man&mdash;in consequence of the
capacity with which they are endued of sending
forth reflected rays to the eye, from every point
of their surfaces and in all directions. In connection
with the reflection of light, the following
curious observation may be stated. Baron Funk,
visiting some silver mines in Sweden, observed,
that, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>‘in a clear day, it was as dark as pitch
underground in the eye of a pit, at sixty or
seventy fathoms deep; whereas, in a cloudy or
rainy day, he could see to read even at 106
fathoms deep. Enquiring of the miners, he was
informed that this is always the case; and reflecting
upon it, he imagined it arose from this circumstance,
that when the atmosphere is full of
clouds, light is reflected from them into the pit

in all directions, and that thereby a considerable
proportion of the rays are reflected perpendicularly
upon the earth: whereas when the atmosphere
is clear, there are no opaque bodies to
reflect the light in this manner, at least in a sufficient
quantity; and rays from the sun himself
can never fall perpendicularly in that country.’&mdash;The
reason here assigned is, in all probability,
the true cause of the phenomenon now described.</p>

<p>8. It is supposed by some philosophers that
<i>light is subject to the same laws of attraction that
govern all other material substances</i>&mdash;and that <i>it
is imbibed and forms a constituent part of certain
bodies</i>. This has been inferred from the phenomena
of the <i>Bolognian stone</i>, and what are
generally called the <i>solar phosphori</i>. The Bolognian
stone was first discovered about the year
1680, by Leascariolo, a shoe-maker of Bologna.
Having collected together some stones of a shining
appearance at the bottom of Monte Paterno, and
being in quest of some alchemical secret, he put
them into a crucible to calcine them&mdash;that is, to
reduce them to the state of cinders. Having
taken them out of the crucible, and exposed them
to the light of the sun, he afterwards happened to
carry them into a dark place, when to his surprise,
he observed that they possessed a self-illuminating
power, and continued to emit faint rays of light
for some hours afterwards. In consequence of
this discovery, the Bolognian spar came into considerable
demand among natural philosophers and
the curious in general; and the best way of preparing
it seems to have been hit upon by the
family of Zagoni, who supplied all Europe with
Bolognian phosphorus, till the discovery of more
powerful phosphoric substances put an end to their
monopoly.&mdash;In the year 1677, Baldwin, a native
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
of Misnia, observed that chalk dissolved in aqua-fortis
exactly resembled the Bolognian stone in
its property of imbibing light, and emitting it
after it was brought into the dark ; and hence it
has obtained the name of Baldwin’s phosphorus.</p>

<p>In 1730 M. du Fay directed his attention to
this subject, and observed that all earthy substances
susceptible of calcination, either by mere
fire, or when assisted by the previous action of
nitrous acid, possessed the property of becoming
more or less luminous, when calcined and exposed
for a short time in the light&mdash;that the most perfect
of these phosphori were limestones, and other
kinds of carbonated lime, gypsum, and particularly
the topaz, and that some diamonds were also
observed to be luminous by simple exposure to
the sun’s rays. Sometime afterwards, Beccaria
discovered that a great variety of other bodies
were convertible into phosphori by exposure to
the mere light of the sun, such as, organic animal
remains, most compound salts, nitre and borax&mdash;all
the farinaceous and oily seeds of vegetable
substances, all the gums and several of the resins&mdash;the
white woods and vegetable fibre, either in the
form of paper or linen; also starch and loaf-sugar
proved to be good phosphori, after being made
thoroughly dry, and exposed to the direct rays of
the sun. Certain animal substances by a similar
treatment were also converted into phosphori;
particularly bone, sinew, glue, hair, horn, hoof,
feathers, and fish-shells. The same property was
communicated to rock crystal and some other of
the gems, by rubbing them against each other so
as to roughen their surfaces, and then placing
them for some minutes in the focus of a lens, by
which the rays of light were concentrated upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
them, at the same time that they were also moderately
heated.</p>

<p>In the year 1768 Mr. Canton contributed some
important facts in relation to solar phosphori, and
communicated a method of preparing a very
powerful one, which, after the inventor, is usually
called <i>Canton’s phosphorus</i>. He affirms that his
phosphorus, enclosed in a glass flask, and hermetically
sealed, retains its property of becoming
luminous for at least four years, without any apparent
decrease of activity. It has also been found
that, if a common box smoothing-iron, heated in
the usual manner, be placed for half a minute on
a sheet of dry, white paper, and the paper be then
exposed to the light, and afterwards examined in
a dark closet, it will be found that the whole
paper will be luminous, that part, however, on
which the iron had stood being much more shining
than the rest.</p>

<p>From the above facts it would seem that certain
bodies have the power of imbibing light and again
emitting it, in certain circumstances, and that
this power may remain for a considerable length
of time. It is observed that the light which such
bodies emit bears an analogy to that which they
have imbibed. In general, the illuminated phosphorus
is reddish; but when a weak light only has
been admitted to it, or when it has been received
through pieces of white paper, the emitted light
is pale or whitish.&mdash;Mr. Morgan, in the seventy-fifth
volume of the Philosophical Transactions,
treats the subject of light at considerable length;
and as a foundation for his reasoning, he assumes
the following data:&mdash;1. That light is a body, and
like all others, subject to the laws of attraction.
2. That light is a heterogeneous body; and that
the same attractive power operates with different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
degrees of force on its different parts. To the
principle of attraction, likewise, Sir Isaac Newton
has referred the most extraordinary phenomena of
light, Refraction and Inflection. He has also
endeavoured to show that light is not only subject
to the law of attraction but of repulsion also, since
it is repelled or reflected from certain bodies. If
such principles be admitted, then, it is highly probable
that the phosphorescent bodies to which we
have adverted have a power of attracting or imbibing
the substance of light, and of retaining or
giving it out under certain circumstances, and
that the matter of light is incorporated at least with
the surface of such bodies. But on this subject,
as on many others, there is a difference of opinion
among philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>9. <i>Light is found to produce a remarkable effect
on Plants and Flowers, and other vegetable productions.</i>
Of all the phenomena which living vegetables
exhibit there are few that appear more extraordinary
than the energy and constancy with
which their stems incline toward the light. Most
of the discous flowers follow the sun in his course.
They attend him to his evening retreat, and meet
his rising lustre in the morning with the same
unerring law. They unfold their flowers on the
approach of this luminary; they follow his course
by turning on their stems, and close them as soon
as he disappears. If a plant, also, is shut up in a
dark room, and a small hole afterwards opened by
which the light of the sun may enter, the plant
will turn towards that hole, and even alter its own
shape in order to get near it; so that though it
was straight before, it will in time become crooked,
that it may get near the light. Vegetables placed
in rooms where they receive light only in one
direction, always extend themselves in that direction.
If they receive light in two directions, they
direct their course towards that which is strongest.
It is not the <i>heat</i> but the <i>light</i> of the sun which
the plant thus covets; for, though a fire be kept
in the room, capable of giving a much stronger
heat than the sun, the plant will turn away from
the fire in order to enjoy the solar light. Trees
growing in thick forests, where they only receive
light from above, direct their shoots almost invariably
upwards, and therefore become much taller
and less spreading than such as stand single.</p>

<p>The <i>green</i> colour of plants is likewise found to
depend on the sun’s light being allowed to shine
on them; for without the influence of the solar
light, they are always of a <i>white</i> colour. It is
found by experiment that, if a plant which has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
been reared in darkness be exposed to the light of
day, in two or three days it will acquire a green
colour perceptibly similar to that of plants which
have grown in open day-light. If we expose to
the light one part of the plant, whether leaf or
branch, this part alone will become green. If we
cover any part of a leaf with an opake substance,
this place will remain white, while the rest becomes
green. The whiteness of the inner leaves
of cabbages is a partial effect of the same cause,
and many other examples of the same kind might
easily be produced. M. Decandolle, who seems
to have paid particular attention to this subject,
has the following remarks: ‘It is certain, that
between the white state of plants vegetating in
darkness, and complete verdure, every possible
intermediate degree exists, determined by the intensity
of the light. Of this any one may easily
satisfy himself by attending to the colour of a
plant exposed to the full day-light; it exhibits in
succession all the degrees of verdure. I had already
seen the same phenomenon, in a particular manner,
by exposing plants reared in darkness to the light
of lamps. In these experiments, I not only saw
the colour come on gradually, according to the
continuance of the exposure to light; but I satisfied
myself, that a certain intensity of permanent
light never gives to a plant more than a certain
degree of colour. The same fact readily shows
itself in nature, when we examine the plants that
grow under shelter or in forests, or when we examine
in succession the state of the leaves that form
the heads of cabbages.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>It is likewise found that the <i>perspiration</i> of
vegetables is increased or diminished, in a certain
measure by the degree of <i>light</i> which falls upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
them. The experiments of Mr. P. Miller and
others, prove that plants uniformly perspire most
in the forenoon, though the temperature of the
air in which they are placed should be unvaried.
M. Guettard likewise informs us that a plant exposed
to the rays of the sun, has its perspiration
increased to a much greater degree than if it had
been exposed to the same heat under the shade.
Vegetables are likewise found to be indebted to
light for their smell, taste, combustibility, maturity,
and the resinous principle, which equally
depend upon this fluid. The aromatic substances,
resins, and volatile oil are the productions of
southern climates, where the light is more pure,
constant, and intense. In fine, another remarkable
property of light on the vegetable kingdom is
that, when vegetables are exposed to open day-light,
or to the sun’s rays, they emit oxygen gas
or vital air. It has been proved that, in the production
of this effect, the sun does not act as a
body that heats. The emission of the gas is
determined by the light: pure air is therefore
separated by the action of light, and the operation
is stronger as the light is more vivid. By this
continual emission of vital air, the Almighty incessantly
purifies the atmosphere, and repairs the loss
of pure air occasioned by respiration, combustion,
fermentation, putrefaction, and numerous other
processes which have a tendency to contaminate
this fluid so essential to the vigor and comfort of
animal life; so that, in this way, by the agency of
light, a due equilibrium is always maintained between
the constituent parts of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject the following
curious phenomenon may be stated, as related by
M. Haggern, a Lecturer on Natural History in
Sweden. One evening he perceived a faint flash
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
of light repeatedly dart from a marigold. Surprised
at such an uncommon appearance, he resolved
to examine it with attention; and, to be
assured it was no deception of the eye, he placed
a man near him, with orders to make a signal at
the moment when he observed the light. They
both saw it constantly at the same moment. The
light was most brilliant on marigolds of an orange
or flame colour, but scarcely visible on pale ones.
The flash was frequently seen on the same flower
two or three times in quick succession; but more
commonly at intervals of several minutes; and
when several flowers in the same place emitted
their light together, it could be observed at a considerable
distance. The phenomenon was remarked
in the months of July and August at sun-set, and
for half an hour when the atmosphere was clear;
but after a rainy day, or when the air was loaded
with vapours, nothing of it was seen. The following
flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid,
in this order:&mdash;1. The Marigold, 2. Monk’s hood,
3. The Orange Lily, 4. The Indian Pink. As to
the <i>cause</i> of this phenomenon, different opinions
may be entertained. From the rapidity of the
flash and other circumstances, it may be conjectured
that electricity is concerned in producing this
appearance. M. Haggern, after having observed
the flash from the orange lily, the anther&aelig; of which
are at considerable distance from the petals, found
that the light proceeded from the petals only;
whence he concludes, that this electrical light is
caused by the pollen which, in flying off, is scattered
on the petals. But, perhaps, the true cause
of it still remains to be ascertained.</p>

<p>10. <i>Light has been supposed to produce a certain
degree of influence on the</i> <small>PROPAGATION OF
SOUND</small>?&mdash;M. Parolette, in a long paper in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
‘Journal de Physique,’ vol. 68, which is copied
into ‘Nicholson’s Philosophical Journal,’ vol. 25,
pp. 28-39,&mdash;has offered a variety of remarks, and
detailed a number of experiments on this subject.
The author states the following circumstances as
having suggested the connection between light and
sound. ‘In 1803, I lived in Paris, and being
accustomed to rise before day to finish a work on
which I had long been employed, I found myself
frequently disturbed by the sound of carriages, as
my windows looked into one of the most frequented
streets in that city. This circumstance
which disturbed me in my studies every morning,
led me to remark, that the appearance of day-break
peculiarly affected the propagation of the sound:
from dull and deep, which it was before day, it
seemed to me to acquire a more sonorous sharpness
in the period that succeeded the dissipation
of darkness. The rolling of the wheels seemed
to announce the friction of some substances grown
more elastic; and my ear on attending to it perceived
this difference diminish, in proportion as
the sound of wheels was confounded with those
excited by the tumult of objects quitting their
nocturnal silence. Struck with this observation,
I attempted to discover whether any particular
causes had deceived my ears. I rose several times
before day for this purpose alone, and was every
time confirmed in my suspicion, that light must
have a peculiar influence on the propagation of
sound. This variation, however, in the manner in
which the air gave sounds might be the effect of
the agitation of the atmosphere produced by the
rarefaction the presence of the sun occasioned;
but the situation of my windows, and the usual
direction of the morning breeze, militated against
this argument.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>The author then proceeds to give a description
of a very delicate instrument, and various apparatus
for measuring the propagation and intensity
of sound, and the various experiments both in the
dark, and in day-light, and likewise under different
changes of the atmosphere, which were made with
his apparatus&mdash;all of which tended to prove that
light had a sensible influence in the propagation
of sound. But the detail of these experiments
and their several results would be too tedious to
be here transcribed.&mdash;The night has generally
been considered as more favourable than the day
for the transmission of sound. ‘That this is the
case (says Parolette) with respect to our ears
cannot be doubted; but this argues nothing against
my opinion. We hear further by night on account
of the silence, and this always contributes to it,
while the noise of a wind favourable to the propagation
of a sound, may prevent the sound from
being heard.’ In reference to the cause which
produces the effect now stated, he proposes the
following queries. ‘Is the atmospheric air more
dense on the appearance of light than in darkness?
Is this greater density of the air or of the elastic
fluid that is subservient to the propagation of
sound, the effect of aeriform substances kept in
this state through the medium of light?’ He is
disposed, on the whole, to conclude, that the effect
in question is owing to the action of light upon
the oxygen of the atmosphere, since oxygen gas
is found by experiment to be best adapted to the
transmission of sound.</p>

<p>Our author concludes his communication with
the following remarks:&mdash;‘Light has a velocity
900,000  times as rapid as that of sound. Whether
it emanate from the sun and reach to our
earth, or act by means of vibrations agitating the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
particles of a fluid of a peculiar nature&mdash;the particles
of this fluid must be extremely light, elastic
and active. Nor does it appear to me unreasonable,
to ascribe to the mechanical action of these
particles set in motion by the sun, the effects its
presence occasions in the vibrations that proceed
from sonorous bodies. The more deeply we investigate
the theory of light, the more we must
perceive, that the powers by which the universe is
moved reside in the imperceptible particles of
bodies; and that the grand results of nature are
but an assemblage of an order of actions that take
place in its infinitely small parts; consequently,
we cannot institute a series of experiments more
interesting than those which tend to develope the
properties of light. Our organs of sense are so
immediately connected with the fluid that
enlightens us, that the notion of having acquired
an idea of the mode of action of this fluid presents
itself to our minds, as the hope of a striking
advance in the knowledge of what composes the
organic mechanism of our life, and of that of
beings which closely follow the rank assigned to
the human species.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is a brief description of some of the leading
properties of light. Of all the objects that
present themselves to the philosophic and contemplative
mind, light is one of the noblest and
most interesting. The action it exerts on all the
combinations of matter, its extreme divisibility,
the rapidity of its propagation, the sublime wonders
it reveals, and the office it performs in what constitutes
the life of organic beings, lead us to consider
it as a substance acting the first part in the
economy of nature. The magic power which this
emanation from the heavens exerts on our organs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of vision, in exhibiting to our view the sublime
spectacle of the universe, cannot be sufficiently
admired. Nor is its power confined to the organs
of sight; all our senses are, in a greater or less
degree, subjected to the action of light, and all
the objects in this lower creation&mdash;whether in the
animal, the vegetable, or the mineral kingdoms&mdash;are,
to a certain extent, susceptible of its influence.
Our globe appears to be little more than
an accumulation of terrestrial materials introduced
into the boundless ocean of the <i>solar light</i>, as a
theatre on which it may display its exhaustless
power and energy, and give animation, beauty and
sublimity to every surrounding scene&mdash;and to
regulate all the powers of nature, and render them
subservient to the purposes for which they were
ordained. This elementary substance appears to
be universal in its movements, and in its influence.
It descends to us from the solar orb. It wings its
way through the voids of space, along a course of
ninety-five millions of miles, till it arrives at the
outskirts of our globe; it passes freely through
the surrounding atmosphere, it strikes upon the
clouds and is reflected by them; it irradiates the
mountains, the vales, the forests, the rivers, the
seas, and all the productions of the vegetable kingdom,
and adorns them with a countless assemblage
of colours. It scatters and disperses its rays from
one end of creation to another, diffusing itself
throughout every sphere of the universe. It flies
without intermission from star to star, and from
suns to planets, throughout the boundless sphere
of immensity, forming a connecting chain and a
medium of communication among all the worlds
and beings within the wide empire of Omnipotence.</p>

<p>When the sun is said “to rule over the day,” it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
is intimated that he acts as the vicegerent of the
Almighty, who has invested him with a mechanical
power of giving light, life and motion to all
the beings susceptible of receiving impressions
from his radiance. As the servant of his creator
he distributes blessings without number among all
the tribes of sentient and intelligent existence.
When his rays illumine the eastern sky in the morning,
all nature is enlivened with his presence.
When he sinks beneath the western horizon, the
flowers droop, the birds retire to their nests, and
a mantle of darkness is spread over the landscape
of the world. When he approaches the equinox
in spring, the animal and vegetable tribes revive,
and nature puts on a new and a smiling aspect.
When he declines towards the winter solstice,
dreariness and desolation ensue, and a temporary
death takes place among the tribes of the vegetable
world.&mdash;This splendid luminary, whose light
embellishes the whole of this lower creation, forms
the most lively representation of Him who is the
source and the centre of all beauty and perfection.
“God is a sun,” the sun of the moral and spiritual
universe, from whom all the emanations of
knowledge, love and felicity descend. “He
covereth himself with light as with a garment.”
and “dwells in light inaccessible and full of
glory.” The felicity and enjoyments of the future
world are adumbrated under the ideas of <i>light</i> and
<i>glory</i>. “The glory of God enlightens the celestial
city,” its inhabitants are represented as “the
saints <i>in light</i>,” it is declared that “their <i>sun</i>
shall no more go down,” and that “the Lord God
is their <i>everlasting light</i>.” So that light not only
cheers and enlivens all beings throughout the
material creation, but is the emblem of the Eternal
Mind, and of all that is delightful and transporting
in the scenes of a blessed immortality.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>In the formation of light, and the beneficent
effects it produces, the wisdom and goodness of
the Almighty are conspicuously displayed. Without
the beams of the sun and the influence of light,
what were all the realms of this world, but an
undistinguished chaos and so many dungeons of
darkness? In vain should we roll our eyes around
to behold, amidst the universal gloom, the flowery
fields, the verdant plains, the flowing streams, the
expansive ocean, the moon walking in brightness,
the planets in their courses, or the innumerable
host of stars. All would be lost to the eye of man,
and the “blackness of darkness” would surround
him for ever. And with how much wisdom has
every thing been arranged in relation to the motion
and minuteness of light? Were it capable of
being transformed into a solid substance, and
retain its present velocity, it would form the most
dreadful and appalling element in nature, and produce
universal terror and destruction throughout
the universe. That this is not impossible, and
could easily be effected by the hand of Omnipotence,
appears from such substances as <i>phosphorus</i>,
where light is supposed to be concentrated in a
solid state. But in all its operations and effects,
as it is now directed by unerring wisdom and
beneficence, it exhibits itself as the most benign
and delightful element connected with the constitution
of the material system, diffusing splendour
and felicity wherever its influence extends.

<h3 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4 id="ON_THE_REFRACTION_OF_LIGHT">ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>Refraction is the turning or bending of the
rays of light out of their natural course.</p>

<p>Light, when proceeding from a luminous body&mdash;without
being reflected from any opake substance
or inflected by passing near one&mdash;is invariably
found to proceed in straight lines without the
least deviation. But if it happens to pass obliquely
from one medium to another, it always
leaves the direction it had before and assumes a
new one. This change of direction, or <i>bending</i>
of the rays of light, is what is called <i>Refraction</i>&mdash;a
term which probably had its origin from the
broken appearance which a staff or a long pole
exhibits, when a portion of it is immersed in water&mdash;the
word, derived from the Latin <i>frango</i>, literally
signifying <i>breaking</i> or bending.</p>

<p>When light is thus refracted, or has taken a
new direction, it then proceeds invariably in a
straight line till it meets with a different medium,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
when it is again turned out of its course. It
must be observed, however, that though we may
by this means cause the rays of light to make any
number of angles in their course, it is impossible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
for us to make them describe a curve, except in
one single case, namely, where they pass through
a medium, the density of which either uniformly
increases or diminishes. This is the case with the
light of the celestial bodies, which passes downwards
through our atmosphere, and likewise with
that which is reflected upwards through it by terrestrial
objects. In both these cases it describes a
curve of the hyperbolic kind; but at all other
times, it proceeds in straight lines, or in what may
be taken for straight lines without any sensible error.</p>

<p>There are two circumstances essential to refraction.
1. That the rays of light shall pass out of
one medium into another of a different density, or
of a greater or less degree of resistance. 2. That
they pass in an <i>oblique</i> direction. The denser the
refracting medium, or that into which the ray
enters, the greater will be its refracting power;
and of two refracting mediums of the same density,
that which is of an oily or inflammable
nature will have a greater refracting power than
the other. The nature of refraction may be more
particularly explained and illustrated by the following
figure and description.</p>

<p>Let ADHI fig. 2, be a body of water, AD its
surface, C a point in which a ray of light BC
enters from the air into the water. This ray, by
the greater density of the water, instead of passing
straight forward in its first direction to K, will be
bent at the point C, and pass along in the direction
CE, which is called the <i>refracted</i> ray. Let the
line FG be drawn perpendicular to the surface of
the water in C, then it is evident that the ray BC,
in passing out of air, a <i>rare</i> medium, into a <i>dense</i>
medium, as water, is refracted into a ray CE which
is <i>nearer</i> to the perpendicular CG than the incident
ray BC, and on the contrary, the ray EC
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
passing out of a denser medium into a rarer will
be refracted into CB, which is <i>farther</i> from the
perpendicular.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 2.</i></p>
<img id="fig002" src="images/fig002.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same thing may be otherwise illustrated as
follows:&mdash;suppose a hole made in one of the sides
of the vessel as at <i>a</i>, and a lighted candle placed
within two or three feet of it, when empty, so that
its flame may be at L, a ray of light proceeding
from it will pass through the hole <i>a</i> in a
straight line LBCK till it reach the bottom of the
vessel at K, where it will form a small circle of
light. Having put a mark at the point K, pour
water into the vessel till it rise to the height AD,
and the round spot that was formerly at K, will
appear at E; that is, the ray which went straight
forward, when the vessel was empty, to K, has
been bent at the point C, where it falls into the
the water, into the line CE. In this experiment
it is necessary that the front of the vessel should
be of glass, in order that the course of the ray
may be seen; and if a little soap be mixed with
the water so as to give it a little mistiness, the ray
CE will be distinctly perceived. If, in place of
fresh water we pour in salt water, it will be found
that the ray BC is more bent at C. In like manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
alcohol will refract the ray BC more than salt
water, and oil more than alcohol, and a piece of
solid glass, of the shape of the water, would refract
the light still more than the oil.</p>

<p>The angle of refraction depends on the obliquity
of the rays falling on the refracting surface being
always such, that the sine of the incident angle is
to the sine of the refracted angle, in a given proportion.
The <i>incident</i> angle is the angle made
by a ray of light and a line drawn perpendicular
to the refracting surface, at the point where the
light enters the surface. The <i>refracted</i> angle is
the angle made by the ray in the refracting medium
with the same perpendicular produced. The <i>sine</i>
of the angle is a line which serves to measure the
angle, being drawn from a point in one leg perpendicular
to the other. The following figure (fig.
3.) will tend to illustrate these definitions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 3.</i></p>
<img id="fig003" src="images/fig003.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In this figure BC is the incident ray, CE the
refracted ray, DG the perpendicular, AD the sine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of the angle of incidence ACD, and HR the sine
of the angle of refraction GCE. Now, it is a proposition
in optics that,&mdash;the sine AD of the angle
of incidence BCD is either accurately or very
nearly in a given proportion to the sine HR of the
angle of refraction GCE. This ratio of the sines
is as four to three, when the refraction is made out
of air into water, that is AD is to HR as four to
three. When the refraction is out of air into
glass, the proportion is about as thirty-one to
twenty, or nearly as three to two. If the refraction
be out of air into diamond it is as five to two,
that is AD : HR :: 5 : 2. The denser the
medium is, the less is the angle and sine of refraction.
If a ray of light MC, were to pass from air
into water, or from empty space into air, in the
direction MC perpendicular to the plane NO
which separates the two mediums, it would suffer
no refraction, because one of the essentials to that
effect is wanting, namely, the <i>obliquity</i> of the
incidence.</p>

<p>It may be also proper to remark, that a ray of
light cannot pass out of a denser medium into a
rarer, if the angle of incidence exceed a certain
limit. Thus a ray of light will not pass out of
glass into air, if the angle of incidence exceed
40&deg; 11&acute;; or out of glass into water, if the angle
of incidence exceed 59&deg; 20&acute;. In such cases refraction
will be changed into reflection.</p>

<p>The following common experiments, which are
easily performed, will illustrate the doctrine of
refraction. Put a shilling or any other small
object which is easily distinguished, into a bason
or any other similar vessel, and then retire to such
a distance as that the edge of the vessel shall just
hide it from your sight. If then you cause another
person to fill the vessel with water, you will then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
find that the shilling is rendered perfectly visible,
although you have not in the slightest degree
changed your position. The reason of this is,
that the rays of light, by which it is rendered visible,
<i>are bent out of their course</i>. Thus, suppose
the shilling to have been placed in the bottom of
the bason at E, (fig. 2.) the ray of light BC
which passes obliquely from the air into water at
C, instead of continuing its course to K, takes the
direction CE, and consequently an object at E
would be rendered visible by rays proceeding in
that direction, when they would not have touched
it had they proceeded in their direct course.</p>

<p>The same principle is illustrated by the following
experiment. Place a bason or square box on a
table, and a candle at a small distance from it;
lay a small rod or stick across the sides of the
bason, and mark the place where the extremity of
the shadow falls, by placing a shilling or other
object at the point; then let water be poured into
the bason, and the shadow will then fall much
nearer to the side next the candle than before.
This experiment may likewise be performed by
simply observing the change produced on the shadow
of the side of the bason itself. Again, put a
long stick obliquely into deep water, and the stick
will seem to be broken at the point where it appears
at the surface of the water&mdash;the part which
is immersed in the water appearing to be bent upwards.
Hence every one must have observed that,
in rowing a boat, the ends of the oars appear bent
or broken every time they are immersed in the
water, and their appearance at such times is a representation
of the course of the refracted rays.
Again, fill a pretty deep jar with water, and you
will observe the bottom of the jar considerably
elevated, so that it appears much shallower than it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
did before the water was poured in, in the proportion
of nearly a third of its depth, which is owing
to the same cause as that which makes the end of a
stick immersed in water appear more elevated than
it would do if there were no refraction. Another
experiment may be just mentioned. Put a sixpence
in a wine-glass, and pour upon it a little
water. When viewed in a certain position, two
sixpences will appear in the glass&mdash;one image of the
sixpence from below, which comes directly to the
eye, and another which appears considerably raised
above the other, in consequence of the rays of
light rising through the water, and being refracted.
In this experiment the wine-glass should not be
more than half filled with water.</p>

<p>The refraction of light explains the causes of
many curious and interesting phenomena both in
the heavens and on the earth. When we stand on
the banks of a river, and look obliquely through
the waters to its bottom, we are apt to think it is
much shallower than it really is. If it be eight
feet deep in reality, it will appear from the bank
to be only six feet; if it be five feet and a half
deep, it will appear only about four feet. This
is owing to the effects of refraction, by which the
bottom of the river is apparently raised by the
refraction of the light passing through the water
into air, so as to make the bottom appear higher
than it really is, as in the experiment with the jar
of water. This is a circumstance of some importance
to be known and attended to in order to personal
safety. For many school-boys and other
young persons have lost their lives by attempting
to ford a river, the bottom of which appeared to
be within their reach, when they viewed it from its
banks: and even adult travellers on horseback
have sometimes fallen victims to this optical deception;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
and this is not the only case in which a
knowledge of the laws of nature may be useful in
guarding us against dangers and fatal accidents.</p>

<p>It is likewise owing to this refractive power in
water, that a skilful marksman who wishes to
shoot fish under water, is obliged to take aim considerably
<i>below</i> the fish as it appears, because it
seems much nearer the top of the water than it
really is. An acquaintance with this property of
light is particularly useful to divers, for, in any of
their movements or operations, should they aim
directly at the object, they would arrive at a point
considerably beyond it; whereas, by having some
idea of the depth of the water, and the angle
which a line drawn from the eye to the object
makes with its surface, the point at the bottom of
the water, between the eye and the object at which
the aim is to be taken, may be easily determined.
For the same reason, a person below water does
not see objects distinctly. For, as the aqueous
humour of the eye has the same refractive power
as water, the rays of light from any object under
water will undergo no refraction in passing through
the cornea, and aqueous humour, and will therefore
meet in a point far behind the retina. But
if any person accustomed to go below water
should use a pair of spectacles, consisting of two
convex lenses, the radius of whose surface is three
tenths of an inch&mdash;which is nearly the radius of
the convexity of the cornea&mdash;he will see objects
as distinctly below water as above it.</p>

<p>It is owing to refraction, that we cannot judge
so accurately of magnitudes and distances in water
as in air. A fish looks considerably larger in
water than when taken out of it. An object
plunged <i>vertically</i> into water always appears contracted,
and the more so as its upper extremity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
approaches nearer the surface of the water. Every
thing remaining in the same situation, if we take
the object gradually out of the water, and it be of
a slender form, we shall see it become larger and
larger, by a rapid developement, as it were, of all
its parts. The distortion of objects, seen through
a crooked pane of glass in a window, likewise
arises from its unequal refraction of the rays that
pass through it. It has been calculated that in
looking through the common glass of a window,
objects appear about the one thirtieth of an inch
out of their real place, by means of the refraction.</p>

<p>Refraction likewise produces an effect upon the
<i>heavenly bodies</i>, so that their apparent positions
are generally different from their real. By the
refractive power of the atmosphere, the sun is
seen before he comes to the horizon in the morning,
and after he sinks beneath it in the evening;
and hence this luminary is never seen in the place
in which it really is, except when it passes the
zenith at noon, to places within the torrid zone.
The sun is visible, when actually thirty-two
minutes of a degree below the horizon, and when
the opake rotundity of the earth is interposed between
our eye and that orb, just on the same
principle as, in the experiment with the shilling
and basin of water, the shilling was seen when the
edge of the basin interposed between it and the
sight. The refractive power of the atmosphere
has been found to be much greater, in certain
cases, than what has been now stated. In the
year 1595 a company of Dutch sailors having been
wrecked on the shores of Nova Zembla, and having
been obliged to remain in that desolate region
during a night of more than three months&mdash;beheld
the sun make his appearance in the horizon
about sixteen days before the time in which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
should have risen according to calculation, and
when his body was actually more than four degrees
below the horizon; which circumstance has been
attributed to the great refractive power of the
atmosphere in those intensely cold regions. This
refraction of the atmosphere, which renders the
apparent rising and setting of the sun both earlier
and later than the real, produces at least one
important beneficial effect. It procures for us the
benefit of a much longer day, at all seasons of the
year, than we should enjoy, did not this property
of the atmosphere produce this effect. It is owing
to the same cause that the disks of the sun and
moon appear elliptical or oval, when seen in the
horizon, their horizontal diameters appearing
longer than their vertical&mdash;which is caused by the
greater refraction of the rays coming from the
lower limb, which is immersed in the densest part
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The illumination of the heavens which precedes
the rising of the sun, and continues sometime after
he is set&mdash;or, what is commonly called the morning
and evening <i>twilight</i>&mdash;is likewise produced by
the atmospherical refraction&mdash;which circumstance
forms a very pleasing and beneficial arrangement
in the system of nature. It not only prolongs to
us the influence of the solar light, and adds nearly
two hours to the length of our day, but prevents
us from being transported all at once from the
darkness of midnight to the splendour of noon-day,
and from the effulgence of day to the gloom
and horrors of the night&mdash;which would bewilder
the traveller and navigator in their journeys by sea
or land, and strike the living world with terror
and amazement.</p>

<p>The following figure will illustrate the position
now stated, and the manner in which the refraction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the atmosphere produces these effects. Let
A <i>a</i> C, fig. 4, represent one half of our globe, and the
dark space between that curve and B <i>r</i> D, the atmosphere.
A person standing on the earth’s surface
at <i>a</i> would see the sun rise at <i>b</i>, when that
luminary was in reality only at <i>c</i>&mdash;more than half a
degree below the horizon. When the rays of the
sun, after having proceeded in a straight line
through empty space, strike the upper part of the
atmosphere at the point <i>d</i>, they are bent out of
their right-lined course, by the refraction of the
atmosphere, into the direction <i>d a</i>, so that the body
of the sun, though actually intercepted by the
curve of the earth’s convexity consisting of a dense
mass of land or water, is actually beheld by the
spectator at <i>a</i>. The refractive power of the atmosphere
gradually diminishes from the horizon
to the zenith, and increases from the zenith to the
horizon, in proportion to the density of its different
strata, being densest at its lower extremity
next the earth, and more rare towards its higher
regions. If a person at <i>a</i> had the sun, <i>e</i>, in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
zenith, he would see him where he really is; for
his rays coming perpendicularly through the atmosphere,
would be equally attracted in all directions,
and would therefore suffer no inflection. But,
about two in the afternoon, he would see the sun
at <i>i</i>, though, in reality, he was at <i>k</i>, thirty-three
seconds lower than his apparent situation. At
about four in the afternoon he would see him at
<i>m</i>, when he is at <i>n</i>, one minute and thirty-eight
seconds from his apparent situation. But at six
o’clock, when we shall suppose he sets, he will be
seen at <i>o</i>, though he is at that time at <i>p</i>, more than
thirty-two minutes below the horizon. These
phenomena arise from the different refractive powers
of the atmosphere at different elevations, and
from the obliquity with which the rays of light
fall upon it; for we see every object along that
line in which the rays from it are directed by the
last medium through which they passed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 4.</i></p>
<img id="fig004" src="images/fig004.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same phenomena happen in relation to the
moon, the planets, the comets, the stars, and every
other celestial body, all of which appear more
elevated, especially when near the horizon, than
their true places. The variable and increasing refraction
from the zenith to the horizon, is a source
of considerable trouble and difficulty in making
astronomical observations, and in nautical calculations.
For, in order to determine the real altitudes
of the heavenly bodies, the exact degree of refraction,
at the observed elevation, must be taken into
account. To the same cause we are to ascribe a
phenomenon that has sometimes occurred&mdash;namely,
that the moon has been seen rising totally eclipsed,
while the sun was still visible in the opposite
quarter of the horizon. At the middle of a total
eclipse of the moon, the sun and moon are in opposition,
or 180 degrees asunder; and, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
were no atmosphere surrounding the earth, these
luminaries, in such a position, could never be seen
above the horizon at the same time. But, by the
refraction of the atmosphere near the horizon, the
bodies of the sun and moon are raised more than
32 minutes above their true places, which is equal,
and sometimes more than equal to the apparent
diameters of these bodies.</p>

<h4 id="EXTRAORDINARY_CASES_OF_REFRACTION"><i>Extraordinary cases of refraction in relation to
terrestrial objects.</i></h4>

<p>In consequence of the accidental condensation
of certain strata of the atmosphere, some very singular
effects have been produced in the apparent
elevation of terrestrial objects to a position much
beyond that in which they usually appear. The
following instance is worthy of notice. It is taken
from the Philosophical Transactions of London
for 1798, and was communicated by W. Latham,
Esq., F.R.S., who observed the phenomenon from
Hastings, on the south coast of England:&mdash;‘On
July 26, 1797, about five o’clock in the afternoon,
as I was sitting in my dining-room in this place,
which is situated upon the Parade, close to the
sea-shore, nearly fronting the south, my attention
was excited by a number of people running down
to the sea-side. Upon inquiring the reason, I
was informed, that the coast of France was plainly
to be distinguished by the naked eye. I immediately
went down to the shore, and was surprised
to find that, even without the assistance of a telescope,
I could very plainly see the cliffs on the
opposite coast, which, at the nearest part, are between
forty and fifty miles distant, and are not to
be discerned from that low situation by the aid of
the best glasses. They appeared to be only a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
miles off, and seemed to extend for some leagues
along the coast. I pursued my walk along the
shore eastward, close to the water’s edge, conversing
with the sailors and fishermen upon the subject.
They at first would not be persuaded of the
reality of the appearance; but they soon became
so thoroughly convinced by the cliffs gradually appearing
more elevated, and approaching nearer, as
it were, that they pointed out and named to me
the different places they had been accustomed to
visit, such as the Bay, the Old Head, or Man, the
Windmill, &amp;c. at Boulogne, St. Vallery, and
other places on the coast of Picardy, which they
afterwards confirmed, when they viewed them
through their telescopes. Their observations were,
that the places appeared as near as if they were
sailing, at a small distance, into the harbours.
The day on which this phenomenon was seen was
extremely hot; it was high water at Hastings
about two o’clock, <small>P.M.</small>, and not a breath of wind
was stirring the whole day.’ From the summit of
an adjacent hill, a most beautiful scene is said to
have presented itself. At one glance the spectators
could see Dungeness, Dover Cliffs, and the
French coast, all along from Calais to St. Vallery,
and, as some affirmed, as far to the westward as
Dieppe, which could not be much less than eighty
or ninety miles. By the telescope, the French
fishing-boats were plainly seen at anchor, and the
different colours of the land on the heights, with
the buildings, were perfectly discernible.</p>

<p>This singular phenomenon was doubtless occasioned
by an extraordinary refraction produced
either by an unusual expansion, or condensation of
the lower strata of the atmosphere, arising from circumstances
connected with the extreme heat of
the season. The objects seem to have been apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
raised far above their natural positions;
for, from the beach at Hastings, a straight line
drawn across towards the French coast, would have
been intercepted by the curve of the waters. They
seem also to have been magnified by the refraction,
and brought apparently four or five times nearer
the eye than in the ordinary state of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The following are likewise instances of unusual
refraction:&mdash;When Captain Colby was ranging
over the coast of Caithness, with the telescope of
his great Theodolite, on the 21st of June, 1819, at
eight o’clock, <small>P.M.</small> from Corryhabbie Hill, near
Mortlich, in Banffshire, he observed a brig over
the land of Caithness, sailing to the westward in
the Pentland Frith, between the Dunnet and Duncansby
heads. Having satisfied himself as to the
fact, he requested his assistants, Lieutenants Robe
and Dawson, to look through the telescope, which
they immediately did, and observed the brig likewise.
It was very distinctly visible for several
minutes, while the party continued to look at it,
and to satisfy themselves as to its position. The
brig could not have been less than from ninety to
one hundred miles distant; and, as the station on
Corryhabbie is not above 850 yards above the sea,
the phenomenon is interesting. The thermometer
was at 44&deg;. The night and day preceding the
sight of the brig had been continually rainy and
misty, and it was not till 7 o’clock of the evening
of the 21st that the clouds cleared off the hill.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Captain Scoresby relates a singular phenomenon
of this kind, which occurred while he was traversing
the Polar seas. His ship had been separated
by the ice from that of his father for a considerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
time, and he was looking out for her every
day, with great anxiety. At length, one evening,
to his utter astonishment, he saw her suspended
in the air, in an inverted position, traced on the
horizon in the clearest colours, and with the most
distinct and perfect representation. He sailed in
the direction in which he saw this visionary phenomenon,
and actually found his father’s vessel by
its indication. He was divided from him by immense
masses of icebergs, and at such a distance,
that it was quite impossible to have seen the ship
in her actual situation, or to have seen her at all,
if her spectrum had not been thus raised several
degrees above the horizon into the sky by this extraordinary
refraction. She was reckoned to be
seventeen miles beyond the visible horizon, and
thirty miles distant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Somerville states, that a friend of her’s,
while standing on the plains of Hindostan, saw the
whole upper chain of the Himalaya mountains
start into view, from a sudden change in the density
of the air, occasioned by a heavy shower, after
a long course of dry and hot weather. In looking
at distant objects through a telescope, over the top
of a ridge of hills, about two miles distant, I have
several times observed, that some of the more distant
objects which are sometimes hid by the interposition
of a ridge of hills, are, at other times,
distinctly visible above them. I have sometimes
observed, that objects near the middle of the field
of view of a telescope, which was in a fixed position,
have suddenly appeared to descend to the
lower part, or ascend to the upper part of the field,
while the telescope remained unaltered. I have
likewise seen, with a powerful telescope, the Bell
Rock Lighthouse, at the distance of about twenty
miles, to appear as if contracted to less than two-thirds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
of its usual apparent height, while every
part of it was quite distinct and well-defined, and
in the course of an hour or less, it appeared to
shoot up to its usual apparent elevation&mdash;all which
phenomena are evidently produced by the same
cause to which we have been adverting.</p>

<p>Such are some of the striking effects produced
by the refraction of light. It enables us to see
objects in a direction where they are not; it raises,
apparently, the bottoms of lakes and rivers: it
magnifies objects when their light passes through
dense mediums: it makes the sun appear above
the horizon, when he is actually below it, and thus
increases the length of our day: it produces the
Aurora and the evening twilight, which forms, in
many instances, the most delightful part of a summer
day: it prevents us from being involved in
total darkness, the moment after the sun has
descended beneath the horizon: it modifies the
appearances of the celestial bodies, and the directions
in which they are beheld: it tinges the sun,
moon, and stars, as well as the clouds, with a ruddy
hue, when near the horizon: it elevates the appearance
of terrestrial objects, and, in certain extraordinary
cases, brings them nearer to our view,
and enables us to behold them when beyond the
line of our visible horizon. In combination with
the power of reflection, it creates visionary landscapes,
and a variety of grotesque and extraordinary
appearances, which delight and astonish, and
sometimes appal the beholders. In short,&mdash;as we
shall afterwards see more particularly&mdash;the refraction
of light through glasses of different figures,
forms the principle on which telescopes and microscopes
are constructed, by which both the remote
and the minute wonders of creation have been disclosed
to view. So that had there been no bodies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
capable of refracting the rays of light, we should
have remained for ever ignorant of many sublime
and august objects in the remote regions of the
universe, and of the admirable mechanism and the
countless variety of minute objects which lie beyond
the range of the unassisted eye in our lower
creation, all of which are calculated to direct our
views, and to enlarge our conceptions of the
Almighty Creator.</p>

<p>In the operation of the law of refraction in these
and numerous other instances, we have a specimen
of the diversified and beneficent effects which the
Almighty can produce by the agency of a single
principle in nature. By the influence of the
simple law of gravitation, the planets are retained
in their orbits, the moon directed in her course
around the earth, and the whole of the bodies
connected with the sun preserved in one harmonious
system. By the same law the mountains of
our globe rest on a solid basis, the rivers flow
through the plains toward the seas, the ocean is
confined to its prescribed boundaries, and the
inhabitants of the earth are retained to its surface
and prevented from flying upwards through the
voids of space. In like manner the law by which
light is refracted produces a variety of beneficial
effects essential to the present constitution of our
world and the comfort of its inhabitants. When
a ray of light enters obliquely into the atmosphere,
instead of passing directly through, it bends a
little downwards, so that the greater portion of
the rays which thus enter the atmospheric mass,
descend by inflection to the earth. We then
enjoy the benefit of that light which would otherwise
have been totally lost. We perceive the
light of day an hour before the solar orb makes its
appearance, and a portion of its light is still retained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
when it has descended nearly eighteen degrees
below our horizon. We thus enjoy, throughout
the year, seven hundred and thirty hours of light
which would have been lost, had it not been
refracted down upon us from the upper regions of
the atmosphere. To the inhabitants of the polar
regions this effect is still more interesting and
beneficial. Were it not for their twilight, they
would be involved, for a much longer period than
they now are, in perpetual darkness; but by the
powerful refraction of light which takes place in
the frigid zones, the day sooner makes its appearance
towards spring, and their long winter nights
are, in certain cases, shortened by a period of
thirty days. Under the poles, where the darkness
of night would continue six months without
intermission, if there were no refraction, total
darkness does not prevail during the one half of
this period. When the sun sets, at the North
pole about the 23rd of September, the inhabitants
(if any) enjoy a perpetual aurora, till he has
descended 18 degrees below the horizon. In his
course through the ecliptic the sun is two months
before he can reach this point, during which time
there is a perpetual twilight. In two months
more he arrives again at the same point, namely
18 degrees below the horizon, when a new twilight
commences, which is continually increasing
in brilliancy, for other two months, at the end of
which the body of this luminary is seen rising in
all its glory. So that, in this region, the light of
day is enjoyed, in a greater or less degree, for ten
months without interruption, by the effects of
atmospheric refraction; and, during the two
months when the influence of the solar light is
entirely withdrawn, the moon is shining above
the horizon for two half months without intermission;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and thus it happens, that no more than two
separate fortnights are passed in absolute darkness;
and this darkness is alleviated by the light
of the stars and the frequent coruscations of the
Aurora Borealis. Hence, it appears, that there
are no portions of our globe that enjoy, throughout
the year, so large a portion of the solar light,
as these northern regions, which is chiefly owing
to the refraction of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The refraction of light by the atmosphere, combined
with its power of reflecting it, is likewise
the cause of that universal light and splendour
which appears on all the objects around us.
Were the earth disrobed of its atmosphere, and
exposed naked to the solar beams&mdash;in this case,
we might see the sun without having day, strictly
so called. His rising would not be preceded by
any twilight as it now is. The most intense darkness
would cover us till the very moment of his
rising; he would then suddenly break out from
under the horizon with the same splendour he
would exhibit at the highest part of his course,
and would not change his brightness till the very
moment of his setting, when in an instant all
would be black as the darkest night. At noon
day we should see the sun like an intensely brilliant
globe shining in a sky as black as ebony,
like a clear fire in the night seen in the midst of
an extensive field, and his rays would show us
the adjacent objects immediately around us; but
the rays which fall on the objects remote from us
would be for ever lost in the expanse of the
heavens. Instead of the beautiful azure of the
sky, and the colours which distinguish the face of
nature by day, we should see nothing but an abyss
of darkness, and the stars shining from a vault as
dark as chaos. Thus there would be no day, such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
as we now enjoy, without the atmosphere: since it
is by the refraction and reflections connected with
this aerial fluid that light is so modified and
directed, as to produce all that beauty, splendour
and harmony, which appear on the concave of the
sky, and on the objects which diversify our terrestrial
abode.</p>

<p>The effect of refraction, in respect to <i>terrestrial</i>
objects, is likewise of a beneficial nature. The
quantity of this refraction is estimated by Dr.
Maskelyne at one-tenth of the distance of the object
observed, expressed in degrees of a great circle.
Hence, if the distance be 10,000 fathoms,
its tenth part 1000 fathoms, is the sixtieth part
of a degree, or one minute, which is the refraction
in altitude. Le Gendre estimates it at one fourteenth;
De Lambre at one eleventh; and others at
a twelfth of the distance; but it must be supposed
to vary at different times and places according to
the varying state of the atmosphere. This refraction,
as it makes objects appear to be raised higher
than they really are, enlarges the extent of our
landscapes, and enables us to perceive distant objects
which would otherwise have been invisible.
It is particularly useful to the navigator at sea.
It is one important object of the mariner when
traversing his course, to look out for capes and
headlands, rocks and islands, so as to descry them
as soon as they are within the reach of his eye. Now,
by means of refraction, the tops of hills and the
elevated parts of coasts, are apparently raised into
the air, so that they may be discovered several
leagues further off on the sea than they would be,
did no such refractive power exist. This circumstance
is therefore a considerable benefit to the
science of navigation, in enabling the mariner to
steer his course aright, and to give him the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
early warning of the track he ought to take, or of
the dangers to which he may be exposed.</p>

<p>In short, the effects produced by the refraction
and reflection of light on the scenery connected
with our globe, teach us that these principles, in
the hand of the Almighty, might be so modified and
directed, as to produce the most picturesque, the
most glorious and wonderful phenomena, such as
mortal eyes have never yet seen, and of which
human imagination can form no conception; and
in other worlds, more resplendent and magnificent
than ours, such scenes may be fully realized, in
combination with the operation of physical principles
and agents, with which we are at present
unacquainted. From what we already know of
the effects of the reflection and the refraction of
light, it is not beyond the bounds of probability
to suppose, that in certain regions of the universe,
light may be reflected and refracted through different
mediums, in such a manner, as to present
to the view of their inhabitants the prominent
scenes connected with distant systems and worlds,
and to an extent, as shall infinitely surpass the
effects produced by our most powerful telescopes.

<h4 id="ON_THE_REFRACTION_OF_LIGHT_THROUGH_SPHERICAL">ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH SPHERICAL
TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCES, OR LENSES.</h4>

<p>It is to the refraction of light that we are indebted
for the use of lenses or artificial glasses to aid the
powers of vision. It lays the foundation of telescopes,
microscopes, camera obscuras, phantasmagorias,
and other optical instruments, by which
so many beautiful, useful, and wonderful effects
have been produced. In order therefore to illustrate
the principles on which such instruments are
constructed, it is necessary to explain the manner
in which the rays of light are refracted and modified,
when passing through spherical mediums of
different forms. I do not intend however to enter
into the minuti&aelig; of this subject, nor into any
abstract mathematical demonstrations, but shall
simply offer a few explanations of general principles,
and several experimental illustrations, which
may enable the general reader to understand the
construction of the optical instruments to be afterwards
described.</p>

<p>A lens is a transparent substance of a different
density from the surrounding medium, and terminating
in two surfaces, either both spherical, or one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
spherical and the other plain. It is usually made of
<i>glass</i>, but may also be formed of any other transparent
substance, as ice, crystal, diamond, pebbles,
or by fluids of different densities and refractive
powers, enclosed between concave glasses. Lenses
are ground into various forms, according to the
purpose they are intended to serve. They may be
generally distinguished as being either <i>convex</i> or
<i>concave</i>. A convex glass is thickest in the middle,
and thinner towards the edges. A concave glass is
thin in the middle, and thicker towards the extremities.
Of these there are various forms, which
are represented in fig. 5. A, is a <i>plano-convex</i>
lens, which has one side plane, and the other
spherical or convex. B, is a <i>plano-concave</i>, which
is plane on the one side and concave on the other.
C, is a <i>double-convex</i>, or one which is spherical on
both sides. D, a <i>double-concave</i>, or concave on
both sides. E, is called a <i>meniscus</i>, which is convex
on one side and concave on the other. F, is
a <i>concavo-convex</i>, the convex side of which is of a
smaller sphere than the concave. In regard to the
<i>degree</i> of convexity or concavity in lenses, it is
evident that there may be almost an infinite variety.
For every convex surface is to be considered as
the segment of a circle, the diameter and radius
of which may vary to almost any extent. Hence,
lenses have been formed by opticians, varying from
one-fiftieth of an inch in radius, to two hundred
feet. When we speak of the length of the radius
of a lens,&mdash;as for instance, when we say that a
lens is two inches or forty inches radius, we mean,
that the convex surface of the glass is the part of
a circle the radius of which, or half the diameter
is two inches or forty inches; or in other words,
were the portion of the sphere on which it is
ground formed into a globe of corresponding convexity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
it would be four inches or eighty inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>axis</i> of a lens is a straight line drawn
through the center of its spherical surface; and
as the spherical sides of every lens are arches of
circles the axis of the lens would pass through
the centre of that circle of which its sides are
segments. <i>Rays</i> are those emanations of light
which proceed from a luminous body, or from a
body that is illuminated. The <i>Radiant</i> is that
body or object which emits the rays of light&mdash;whether
it be a self-luminous body, or one that
only reflects the rays of light. Rays may proceed
from a Radiant in different directions. They may
be either parallel, converging, or diverging.
<i>Parallel</i> rays are those which proceed <i>equally distant</i>
from each other through their whole course.
Rays proceeding from the sun, the planets, the
stars, and distant terrestrial objects are considered
as parallel, as in fig. 6. <i>Converging</i> rays are such
as, proceeding from a body, approach nearer and
nearer in their progress, tending to a certain point
where they all unite. Thus, the rays proceeding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
from the object AB, (fig. 7.) to the point F, are
said to converge towards that point. All convex
glasses cause parallel rays, which fall upon them
to converge in a greater or less degree; and they
render converging rays still more convergent. If
AB, fig. 7. represent a convex lens, and H G I
parallel rays falling upon it, they will be refracted
and converge towards the point F, which
is called the <i>focus</i>, or burning point; because,
when the sun’s rays are thus converged to a point
by a large lens, they set on fire combustible substances.
In this point the rays meet and intersect
each other. <i>Diverging rays</i> are those which, proceeding
from any point as A, fig. 8, continually
recede from each other as they pass along in their
course towards BC. All the rays which proceed
from near objects as a window in a room, or an
adjacent house or garden are more or less divergent.
The following figures show the effects of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
parallel, converging and diverging rays in passing
through a double convex lens.</p>

<p>Fig. 9, shows the effects of parallel rays,
KA, DE, LB, falling on a convex glass AB. The
rays which fall near the extremities at A and B,
are bent or refracted towards CF, the focus, and
centre of convexity. It will be observed, that
they are less refracted as they approach the center
of the lens, and the central ray DEC, which is
called the <i>axis</i> of the lens, and which passes
through its center, suffers no refraction. Fig. 10,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
exhibits the course of <i>converging</i> rays, when passing
through a similar lens. In this case the rays
converge to a focus <i>nearer</i> to the lens than the
center; for a convex lens uniformly increases the
convergence of converging rays. The converging
rays here represented, may be conceived as having
been refracted by another convex lens of a longer
focus, and, passing on towards a point of convergence,
were intercepted by the lens AB. The
point D is the place where the rays would have
converged to a focus, had they not been thus intercepted.
Fig. 11, represents the course of
diverging rays when falling on a double convex
glass. In this case the rays D B, D A, &amp;c., after
passing through the lens, converge to a focus at a
point considerably farther from the lens than its
centre, as at F. Such rays must be considered as
proceeding from near objects, and the fact may be
illustrated by the following experiment. Take a
common reading-glass, and hold it in the rays of
the sun, opposite a sheet of writing-paper or a
white wall, and observe <i>at what distance</i> from the
glass the rays on the paper converge to a small
distinct white spot. This distance gives the focal
length of the lens by parallel rays. If now, we
hold the glass within a few feet of a window, or
a burning candle, and receive its image on the
paper, the focal distance of the image from the
glass will be found to be longer. If, in the former
case, the focal distance was twelve inches,&mdash;in the
latter case it will be thirteen, fifteen, or sixteen
inches, according to the distance of the window or
the candle from the glass.</p>

<p>If the lens A B, fig. 9, on which parallel rays
are represented as falling, were a <i>plano-convex</i>,
as represented at A, fig, 5, the rays would converge
to a point P, at double the radius, or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
whole diameter of the sphere of which it is a segment.
If the thickness of a plano-convex be considered,
and if it be exposed on its convex side to
parallel rays, as those of the sun, the focus will be
at the distance of <i>twice the radius, wanting two-thirds
of the thickness of the lens</i>. But if the same
lens be exposed with its plane side to parallel rays,
the focus will then be precisely at the distance of
twice the radius from the glass.</p>

<p>The effects of <i>concave</i> lenses are directly opposite
to those of convex. Parallel rays, striking one
of those glasses, instead of converging towards a
point, are made to <i>diverge</i>. Rays already divergent
are rendered more so, and convergent rays
are made less convergent. Hence objects seen
through concave glasses appear considerably smaller
and more distant than they really are. The following
diagram, fig. 12, represents the course of
parallel rays through a double concave lens, where
the parallel rays T A, D E, I B, &amp;c., when passing
through the concave glass A B, diverge into
the rays G L, E C, H P, &amp;c., as if they proceeded
from F, a point before the lens, which is the principal
focus of the lens.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 12.</i></p>
<img id="fig012" src="images/fig012.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The principal focal distance E F, is the same as
in convex lenses. Concave glasses are used to
correct the imperfect vision of short-sighted persons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
As the form of the eye of such persons is
too convex, the rays are made to converge before
they reach the optic nerve; and therefore a concave
glass, causing a little divergency, assists this
defect of vision, by diminishing the effect produced
by the too great convexity of the eye, and lengthening
its focus. These glasses are seldom used, in
modern times, in the construction of optical instruments,
except as eye-glasses for small pocket
perspectives, and opera glasses.</p>

<p><i>To find the focal distance of a concave glass.</i>
Take a piece of paste-board or card paper, and
cut a round hole in it, not larger than the diameter
of the lens; and, on another piece of paste-board,
describe a circle whose diameter is just double the
diameter of the hole. Then apply the piece with
the hole in it to the lens, and hold them in the
sun-beams, with the other piece at such a distance
behind, that the light proceeding from the hole
may spread or diverge so as precisely to fill the
circle; then the distance of the circle from the
lens is equal to its virtual focus, or to its radius,
if it be a double concave, and to its diameter, if a
plano-concave. Let <i>d, e</i>, (fig. 12,) represent the
diameter of the hole, and <i>g, i</i>, the diameter of the
circle, then the distance C, I, is the virtual focus
of the lens.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>The <i>meniscus</i> represented at E, fig. 5, is like the
crystal of a common watch, and as the convexity
is the same as the concavity, it neither magnifies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
nor diminishes. Sometimes, however, it is made
in the form of a crescent, as at F, fig. 5, and is
called a <i>concavo-convex</i> lens; and, when the convexity
is greater than the concavity, or, when it is
thickest in the middle, it acts nearly in the same
way as a double or plano-convex lens of the same
focal distance.</p>

<h5><i>Of the</i> <small>IMAGES</small> <i>formed by convex lenses.</i></h5>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, and which
would naturally excite admiration, were it not so
common and well known, that <i>when the rays of
light from any object are refracted through a convex
lens, they paint a distinct and accurate picture
of the object before it, in all its colours, shades,
and proportions</i>. Previous to experience, we could
have had no conception that light, when passing
through such substances, and converging to a point,
could have produced so admirable an effect,&mdash;an
effect on which the construction and utility of all
our optical instruments depend. The following
figure will illustrate this position.
Let L, N, represent a double convex lens, A, C,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
<i>a</i>, its axis, and OB, an object perpendicular to it.
A ray passing from the extremity of the object at O,
after being refracted by the lens at F, will pass on
in the direction FI, and form an image of that
part of the object at I. This ray will be the axis
of all the rays which fall on the lens from the
point O, and I will be the focus where they will
all be collected. In like manner BCM, is the
axis of that parcel of rays which proceed from the
extremity of the object B, and their focus will be
at M; and since all the points in the object between
O, and B, must necessarily have their foci
between I and M, a complete picture of the points
from which they come will be depicted, and consequently
an image of the whole object OB.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 13.</i></p>
<img id="fig013" src="images/fig013.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is obvious, from the figure, that the image of
the object is formed in the focus of the lens, in an
<i>inverted position</i>. It must necessarily be in this
position, as the rays cross at C, the centre of the
lens; and as it is impossible that the rays from
the upper part of the object O, can be carried by
refraction to the upper end of the image at M.
This is a universal principle in relation to convex
lenses of every description, and requires to be attended
to in the construction and use of all kinds
of telescopes and microscopes. It is easily illustrated
by experiment. Take a convex lens of
eight, twelve, or fifteen inches focal distance,
such as a reading glass, or the glass belonging to
a pair of spectacles, and holding it, at its focal
distance from a white wall, in a line with a burning
candle, the flame of the candle will be seen
depicted on the wall in an inverted position, or
turned upside down. The same experiment may be
performed with a window-sash, or any other bright
object. But, the most beautiful exhibition of the
images of objects formed by convex lenses, is made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
by darkening a room, and placing a convex lens of
a long focal distance in a hole cut out of the window-shutter;
when a beautiful inverted landscape,
or picture of all the objects before the window,
will be painted on a white paper or screen placed
in the focus of the glass. The image thus formed
exhibits not only the proportions and colours, but
also the motions of all the objects opposite the
lens, forming as it were a living landscape. This
property of lenses lays the foundation of the
camera obscura, an instrument to be afterwards
described.</p>

<p>The following principles in relation to images
formed by convex lenses may be stated. 1. That
<i>the image subtends the same angle at the centre of
the glass as the object itself does</i>. Were an eye
placed at C, the centre of the lens LN, fig. 13, it
would see the object OB, and the image IM
under the same optical angle, or, in other words,
they would appear equally large. For, whenever
right lines intersect each other, as OI and BM,
the opposite angles are always equal, that is, the
angle MCI is equal to the angle OCB. 2. <i>The
length of the image formed by a convex lens, is to
the length of the object, as the distance of the image
is to the distance of the object from the lens</i>: that
is, MI is to OB :: as <span class="smcap">Ca</span> to CA. Suppose the
distance of the object CA from the lens, to be
forty-eight inches, the length of the object OB =
sixteen inches, and the distance of the image from
the lens, six inches, then the length of the
image will be found by the following proportion,
48 : 16 :: 6 : 2, that is, the length of the image,
in such a case, is two inches. 3. <i>If the object be
at an infinite distance, the image will be formed
exactly in the focus.</i> 4. <i>If the object be at the
same distance from the lens as its focus, the image</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
<i>is removed to an infinite distance on the opposite
side</i>; in other words, the rays will proceed in a
<i>parallel</i> direction. On this principle, lamps on
the streets are sometimes directed to throw a
bright light along a foot-path where it is wanted,
when a large convex glass is placed at its focal
distance from the burner; and on the same principle,
light is thrown to a great distance from lighthouses,
either by a very large convex lens of a
short focal distance, or by a concave reflector.
5. <i>If the object be at double the distance of the
focus from the glass, the image will also be at
double the distance of the focus from the glass.</i>
Thus, if a lens of six inches focal distance be held
at twelve inches distance from a candle, the image
of the candle will be formed at twelve inches from
the glass on the other side. 6. <i>If the object be
a little further from the lens than its focal distance,
an image will be formed, at a distance from the
object, which will be greater or smaller in proportion
to the distance.</i> For example, if a lens five
inches focus, be held at a little more than five
inches from a candle, and a wall or screen at five
feet six inches distant, receive the image, a large
and inverted image of the candle will be depicted,
which will be magnified in proportion as the distance
of the wall from the candle exceeds the
distance of the lens from the candle. Suppose the
distance of the lens to be five and a half inches, then
the distance of the wall where the image is formed,
being twelve times greater, the image of the candle
will be magnified twelve times. If MI (fig. 13.)
be considered as the object, then OB will represent
the magnified image on the wall. On this
principle the image of the object is formed by the
small object glass of a compound microscope. On
the same principle the large pictures are formed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the Magic Lantern and the Phantasmagoria; and
in the same way small objects are represented in a
magnified form, on a sheet or wall by the Solar
microscope. 7. <i>All convex lenses magnify the
objects seen through them, in a greater or less degree.</i>
The shorter the focal distance of the lens,
the greater is the magnifying power. A lens four
inches focal distance, will magnify objects placed
in the focus, two times in length and breadth; a
lens two inches focus will magnify four times, a lens
one inch focus eight times; a lens half an inch focus
sixteen times, &amp;c. supposing eight inches to be
the least distance at which we see near objects
distinctly. In viewing objects with small lenses,
the object to be magnified should be placed exactly
at the focal distance of the lens, and the eye at
about the same distance on the other side of the
lens. When we speak of magnifying power, as,
for example, that a lens one inch focal distance
magnifies objects eight times, it is to be understood
of the <i>lineal</i> dimensions of the object. But
as every object at which we look has breadth as
well as length, the <i>surface</i> of the object is in
reality magnified sixty-four times, or the square
of its lineal dimensions; and for the same reason
a lens half an inch focal distance magnifies the
<i>surfaces</i> of objects 256 times.</p>

<h4 id="REFLECTIONS_DEDUCED_FROM_THE_PRECEDING_SUBJECT"><i>Reflections deduced from the preceding subject.</i></h4>

<p>Such are some of the leading principles which
require to be recognised in the construction of
refracting telescopes, microscopes, and other
dioptric instruments whose performance chiefly
depends on the <i>refraction</i> of light.&mdash;It is worthy
of particular notice that all the phenomena of
optical lenses now described, depend upon that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
peculiar property which the Creator has impressed
upon the rays of light, that, <i>when they are refracted
to a focus by a convex transparent substance,
they depict an accurate image of the objects
whence they proceed</i>. This, however common,
and however much overlooked by the bulk of
mankind, is indeed a very wonderful property
with which light has been endued. Previous to
experience we could have had no conception that
such an effect would be produced; and, in the
first instance, we could not possibly have traced it
to all its consequences. All the objects in creation
might have been illuminated as they now are,
for aught we know, without sending forth either
direct or reflected rays <i>with the property of forming
exact representations of the objects whence
they proceeded</i>. But this we find to be a universal
law in regard to light of every description,
whether as emanating directly from the sun, or as
reflected from the objects he illuminates, or as
proceeding from bodies artificially enlightened. It
is a law or a property of light not only in our own
system, but throughout all the systems of the
universe to which mortal eyes have yet penetrated.
The rays from the most distant star which astronomers
have descried, are endued with this property,
otherwise they could never have been perceived
by means of our optical instruments; for it
is by the pictures or images formed in these instruments
that such distant objects are brought to
view. Without this property of light, therefore,
we should have had no telescopes, and consequently
we could not have surveyed, as we can
now do, the hills and vales, the deep caverns, the
extensive plains, the circular ranges of mountains,
and many other novel scenes which diversify the
surface of our moon. We should have known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
nothing of the stupendous spots which appear on
the surface of the sun&mdash;of the phases of Venus&mdash;of
the satellites and belts of Jupiter&mdash;of the majestic
rings of Saturn&mdash;of the existence of Uranus
and his six moons,&mdash;or of the planets Vesta, Juno,
Ceres, and Pallas, nor could the exact bulks of
any of these bodies have been accurately determined.
But, above all, we should have been entirely
ignorant of the wonderful phenomena of
double stars&mdash;which demonstrate that suns revolve
around suns&mdash;of the thousands and millions of
stars which crowd the profundities of the Milky
Way and other regions of the heavens&mdash;of the
thousands of Nebul&aelig; or starry systems which are
dispersed throughout the immensity of the firmament,
and many other objects of sublimity and
grandeur, which fill the contemplative mind with
admiration and awe, and raise its faculties to
higher conceptions than it could otherwise have
formed of the omnipotence and grandeur of the
Almighty Creator.</p>

<p>Without this property of the rays of light we
should likewise have wanted the use of the microscope&mdash;an
instrument which has disclosed a world
invisible to common eyes, and has opened to our
view the most astonishing exhibitions of Divine
mechanism, and of the wisdom and intelligence of
the Eternal Mind. We should have been ignorant
of those tribes of living beings, invisible to
the unassisted eye, which are found in water,
vinegar, and many other fluids&mdash;many of which
are twenty thousand times smaller than the least
visible point, and yet display the same admirable
skill and contrivance in their construction, as are
manifested in the formation of the larger animals.
We should never have beheld the purple tide of
life, and even the globules of the blood rolling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
with swiftness through veins and arteries smaller
than the finest hair; or had the least conception
that numberless species of animated beings, so
minute that a million of them are less than a grain
of sand, could have been rendered visible to human
eyes, or that such a number of vessels, fluids,
movements, diversified organs of sensation, and
such a profusion of the richest ornaments and the
gayest colours could have been concentrated in a
single point. We should never have conceived
that even the atmosphere is replenished with invisible
animation, that the waters abound with
countless myriads of sensitive existence, that the
whole earth is full of life, and that there is scarcely
a tree, plant, or flower, but affords food and shelter
to a species of inhabitants peculiar to itself,
which enjoy the pleasures of existence and share
in the bounty of the Creator. We could have
formed no conception of the beauties and the
varieties of mechanism which are displayed in the
scenery of that invisible world to which the microscope
introduces us&mdash;beauties and varieties, in
point of ornament and delicate contrivance, which
even surpass what is beheld in the visible operations
and aspect of nature around us. We find
joints, muscles, a heart, stomach, entrails, veins,
arteries, a variety of motions, a diversity of forms,
and a multiplicity of parts and functions&mdash;in
breathing atoms. We behold in a small fibre of
a peacock’s feather, not more than one-eighth of an
inch in length, a profusion of beauties no less admirable
than is presented by the whole feather to
the naked eye&mdash;a stem sending out multitudes of
lateral branches, each of which emits numbers of
little sprigs, which consist of a multitude of bright
shining globular parts, adorned with a rich variety
of colours. In the sections of plants, we see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
thousands and ten thousands of tubes and pores,
and other vessels for the conveyance of air and
juices for the sustenance of the plant; in some
instances, more than ten hundred thousand of
these being compressed within the space of a
quarter of an inch in diameter, and presenting to
the eye the most beautiful configurations. There
is not a weed, nor a moss, nor the most insignificant
vegetable, which does not show a multiplicity
of vessels disposed in the most curious manner for
the circulation of sap for its nourishment, and
which is not adorned with innumerable graces for
its embellishment. All these and ten thousands
of other wonders which lie beyond the limits of
natural vision, in this new and unexplored region
of the universe, would have been for ever concealed
from our view, had not the Creator endued
the rays of light with the power of <i>depicting the
images of objects</i>, when refracted by convex transparent
substances.</p>

<p>In this instance, as well as in many others, we
behold a specimen of the admirable and diversified
effects, which the Creator can produce from the
agency of a single principle in nature. By means
of optical instruments, we are now enabled to take
a more minute and expansive view of the amazing
operations of nature, both in heaven and on earth,
than former generations could have surmised.
These views tend to raise our conceptions of the
attributes of that Almighty Being, who presides
over all the arrangements of the material system,
and to present them to our contemplation in a
new, a more elevated, and expansive point of view.
There is, therefore, a connection which may be
traced between the apparently accidental principle
of the rays of light forming images of objects, and
the comprehensive views we are now enabled to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
take of the character and perfections of the Divinity.
Without the existence of the law or principle
alluded to, we could not, in the present state,
have formed precisely the same conceptions either
of the Omnipotence, or of the wisdom and intelligence
of the Almighty. Had no microscope ever
been invented, the idea never could have entered
into the mind of man, that worlds of living beings
exist beyond the range of natural vision, that
organized beings possessed of animation exist,
whose whole bulk is less than the ten hundred
thousandth part of the smallest grain of sand;
that, descending from a visible point to thousands
of degrees beyond it, an invisible world exists,
peopled with tribes of every form and size, the
extent of which, and how far it verges towards
infinity downwards, mortals have never yet explored,
and perhaps will never be able to comprehend.
This circumstance alone presents before us
the perfections of the divinity in a new aspect,
and plainly intimates that it is the will and the
intention of the Deity, that we should explore his
works, and investigate the laws by which the
material world is regulated, that we may acquire
more expansive views of his character and operations.
The inventions of man in relation to art
and science, are not therefore to be considered as
mere accidental occurrences, but as special arrangements
in the divine government, for the purpose
of carrying forward the human mind to more
clear and ample views of the scenes of the
universe, and of the attributes and the agency of
Him “who is wonderful in counsel and excellent
in working.”

<h3 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h4 id="ON_THE_REFLECTION_OF_LIGHT">ON THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>The <i>reflection</i> of the rays of light is that property
by which&mdash;after approaching the surfaces of bodies,
they are thrown back, or repelled. It is in consequence
of this property that all the objects
around us, and all the diversified landscapes on our
globe, are rendered visible. It is by light reflected
from their surfaces that we perceive the planetary
bodies and their satellites, the belts of Jupiter,
the rings of Saturn, the various objects which
diversify the surface of the Moon, and all the
bodies in the universe which have no light of their
own. When the rays of light fall upon rough and
uneven surfaces, they are reflected very irregularly
and scattered in all directions, in consequence of
which thousands of eyes, at the same time, may
perceive the same objects, in all their peculiar
colours, aspects, and relations. But, when they
fall upon certain smooth and polished surfaces,
they are reflected with regularity, and according to
certain laws. Such surfaces, when highly polished,
are called <i>Mirrors</i> or <i>Speculums</i>; and it is to the
reflection of light from such surfaces, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
effects it produces, that I am now to direct the
attention of the reader.</p>

<p>Mirrors or Specula, may be distinguished into
three kinds, <i>plane</i>, <i>concave</i>, and <i>convex</i>, according
as they are bounded by plane or spherical surfaces.
These are made either of <i>metal</i> or of <i>glass</i>, and
have their surfaces highly polished for the purpose
of reflecting the greatest number of rays. Those
made of glass are foliated or quicksilvered on one
side; and the metallic specula are generally formed
of a composition of different metallic substances,
which, when accurately polished, is found to reflect
the greatest quantity of light. I shall, in the
first place, illustrate the phenomena of reflection
produced by <i>plane-mirrors</i>.</p>

<p>When light impinges, or falls, upon a polished
flat surface, rather more than the half of it is reflected,
or thrown back in a direction similar to
that of its approach; that is to say, if it fall <i>perpendicularly</i>
on the polished surface, it will be
perpendicularly reflected; but if it fall <i>obliquely</i>,
it will be reflected with the same obliquity. Hence,
the following fundamental law, regarding the reflection
of light, has been deduced both from experiment
and mathematical demonstration, namely,
that <i>the angle of reflection is, in all cases, exactly
equal to the angle of incidence</i>. This is a law
which is universal in all cases of reflection, whether
it be from plane or spherical surfaces, or whether
these surfaces be concave or convex, and which
requires to be recognized in the construction of
all instruments which depend on the reflection of
the rays of light. The following figure (fig. 14)
will illustrate the position now stated.</p>

<p>Let AB represent a plane mirror, and CD a
line or ray of light perpendicular to it. Let FD
represent the <i>incident</i> ray from any object, then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
DE will be the reflected ray, thrown back in the
direction from D to E, and it will make with the
perpendicular CD the same angle which the incident
ray FD did with the same perpendicular, that
is, the angle FDC will be equal to the angle EDC,
in all cases of obliquity. The incident ray of light
may be considered as rebounding from the mirror,
like a tennis ball from a marble pavement, or the
wall of a court.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 14.</i></p>
<img id="fig014" src="images/fig014.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In viewing objects by reflection we see them in
a different direction from that in which they really
are, namely, along the line in which the rays come
to us last. Thus, if AB (fig. 15) represent a
plane mirror, the image of an object C appears to
the eye at E behind the mirror, in the direction
EG, and always in the intersection G of the perpendicular
CG, and the reflected ray EG&mdash;and
consequently at G as far behind the mirror, as the
object C is before it. We therefore see the image
in the line EG, the direction in which the reflected
rays proceed. A plane mirror does not alter the
figure or size of objects; but the whole image is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
equal and similar to the whole object, and has a
like situation with respect to one side of the plane,
that the object has with respect to the other.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 15.</i></p>
<img id="fig015" src="images/fig015.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. Walker illustrates the manner in which we
see our faces in a mirror by the following figure (16).
<small>AB</small> represents a mirror, and OC, a person looking
into it. If we conceive a ray proceeding from the
forehead <small>CE</small>, it will be sent to the eye at <small>O</small>, agreeably
to the angle of incidence and reflection. But
the mind puts <small>CEO</small> into one line, and the forehead
is seen at <small>H</small>, as if the lines <small>CEO</small> had turned on a
hinge at <small>E</small>.&mdash;It seems a wonderful faculty of the
mind to put the two oblique lines <small>CE</small> and <small>OE</small> into
one straight line <small>OH</small>, yet it is seen every time we
look at a mirror. For the ray has really travelled
from <small>C</small> to <small>E</small>, and from <small>E</small> to <small>O</small>, and it is that journey
which determines the distance of the object; and
hence we see ourselves as far beyond the mirror
as we stand from it. Though a ray is here taken
only from one part of the face, it may be easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
conceived that rays from every other part of the
face must produce a similar effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 16.</i></p>
<img id="fig016" src="images/fig016.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In every plain mirror, the image is always equal
to the object, at what distance soever it may be
placed; and as the mirror is only at half the distance
of the image from the eye, it will completely
receive an image of <i>twice</i> its own length. Hence
a man six feet high may view himself completely
in a looking glass of three feet in length, and half
his own breadth; and this will be the case at whatever
distance he may stand from the glass. Thus,
the man AC (fig. 17) will see the whole of his
own image in the glass <small>AB</small>, which is but one half
as large as himself. The rays from the head pass
to the mirror in the line <span class="smcap">Aa</span>, perpendicular to the
mirror, and are returned to the eye in the same
line; consequently, having travelled twice the
length <span class="smcap">Aa</span>, the man must see his head at B. From
his feet C rays will be sent to the bottom of the
mirror at <small>B</small>; these will be reflected at an equal
angle to the eye in the direction <small>BA</small>, as if they
had proceeded in the direction <span class="smcap">DbA</span>, so that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
man will see his foot at D, and consequently his
whole figure at BD.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 17.</i></p>
<img id="fig017" src="images/fig017.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A person when looking into a mirror, will always
see his own image as far beyond the mirror as he
is before it, and as he moves to or from it, the
image will, at the same time, move towards or from
him on the other side; but apparently with a double
velocity, because the two motions are equal
and contrary. In like manner, if while the spectator
is at rest, an object be in motion, its image
behind the mirror will be seen to move at the same
time. And if the spectator moves, the images of
objects that are at rest will appear to approach, or
recede from him, after the same manner as when
he moves towards real objects; plane mirrors reflecting
not only the object, but the distance also,
and that exactly in its natural dimensions&mdash;The
following principle is sufficient for explaining most
of the phenomena seen in a plane mirror, namely;&mdash;<i>That
the image of an object seen in a plane mirror,
is always in a perpendicular to the mirror
joining the object and the image, and that the image
is as much on one side the mirror, as the object is
on the other</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<h4><i>Reflection by Convex and Concave Mirrors.</i></h4>

<p>Both convex and concave mirrors are formed of
portions of a sphere. A convex speculum is
ground and polished in a <i>concave</i> dish or tool
which is a portion of a sphere, and a concave speculum
is ground upon a convex tool. The inner
surface of a sphere brings parallel rays to a focus
at <i>one fourth</i> of its diameter, as represented in the
following figure, where C is the centre of the
sphere on which the concave speculum AB is
formed, and F the focus where parallel rays from
a distant object would be united, after reflection,
that is, at one half the radius, or one fourth of the
diameter from the surface of the speculum. Were
a speculum of this kind presented to the sun, F
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
would be the point where the reflected rays would
be converged to a focus, and set fire to combustible
substances if the speculum be of a large diameter,
and of a short focal distance. Were a candle
placed in that focus, its light would be reflected
parallel as represented in the figure. These are
properties of concave specula which require to be
particularly attended to in the construction of reflecting
telescopes. It follows, from what has
been now stated, that if we intend to form a speculum
of a certain focal distance,&mdash;for example, two
feet, it is necessary that <i>it should be ground upon
a tool whose radius is double that distance</i>, or four
feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 18.</i></p>
<img id="fig018" src="images/fig018.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<h4><i>Properties of Convex Mirrors.</i></h4>

<p>From a convex surface, parallel rays when reflected
are made to diverge; convergent rays are reflected
less convergent; and divergent rays are rendered
more divergent. It is the nature of all convex
mirrors and surfaces to scatter or <i>disperse</i> the
rays of light, and in every instance to impede their
convergence. The following figure shows the
course of parallel rays as reflected from a convex
mirror. AEB is the convex surface of the mirror;
and KA, IE, LB, parallel rays falling upon it.
These rays, when they strike the mirror, are made
to diverge in the direction AG, BH, &amp;c. and both
the parallel and divergent rays are here represented
as they appear in a dark chamber, when a convex
mirror is presented to the solar rays. The dotted
lines denote only the course or tendency of the reflected
rays, towards the <i>virtual</i> focus F, were they
not intercepted by the mirror. This virtual focus
is just equal to half the radius CE.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 19.</i></p>
<img id="fig019" src="images/fig019.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following are some of the properties of
convex mirrors: 1. The image appears always
erect, and behind the reflecting surface. 2. <i>The
image is always smaller than the object</i>, and the
diminution is greater in proportion as the object is
further from the mirror, but if the object touch
the mirror, the image at the point of contact is of
the same size as the object. 3. The image does
not appear so far behind the reflecting surface as
in a plain mirror. 4. The image of a straight object,
placed either parallel or oblique to the mirror
is seen <i>curved</i> in the mirror; because the different
points of the object are not all at an equal distance
from the surface of the mirror. 5. Concave
mirrors have a <i>real</i> focus where an image is
actually formed; but convex specula have only a
<i>virtual</i> focus, and this focus is behind the mirror;
no image of any object being formed before it.</p>

<p>The following are some of the purposes to
which convex mirrors are applied. They are
frequently employed by painters for reducing the
proportions of the objects they wish to represent,
as the images of objects diminish in proportion to
the smallness of the radius of convexity, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the distances of objects from the surface of the
mirror. They form a fashionable part of modern
furniture, as they exhibit a large company assembled
in a room, with all the furniture it contains,
in a very small compass, so that a large hall with
all its objects, and even an extensive landscape,
being reduced in size, may be seen from one point
of view. They are likewise used as the small
specula of those reflecting telescopes which are
fitted up on the <i>Cassegrainian</i> plan, and in the construction
of Smith’s Reflecting Microscope. But
on the whole, they are very little used in the construction
of optical instruments.</p>

<h5><i>Properties of Concave speculums.</i></h5>

<p>Concave specula have properties very different
from those which are convex; they are of
more importance in the construction of reflecting
telescopes and other optical instruments; and
therefore require more minute description and
illustration. Concave mirrors cause parallel rays
to converge; they increase the convergence of
rays that are already converging; they diminish
the divergence of diverging rays; and, in some
cases, render them parallel and even convergent;
which effects are all in proportion to the concavity
of the mirror. The following figures show the
course of diverging and parallel rays as reflected
from concave mirrors.</p>

<p>Fig. 20 represents the course of <i>parallel</i> rays,
and AB, the concave mirror on which they fall.
In this case, they are reflected so as to unite at F,
which point is distant from its surface <i>one fourth</i>
of the diameter of the sphere of the mirror. This
point is called the focus of parallel rays, or <i>the
true focus of the mirror</i>. And, since the sun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
beams are parallel among themselves, if they are
received on a concave mirror, they will all be reflected
to that point, and there burn in proportion
to the quantity of rays collected by the mirror.
Fig. 21. shows the direction of <i>diverging</i> rays,
or those which proceed from a near object. These
rays proceeding from an object further from the
mirror than the true focal point, as from D to A
and to B, are reflected converging and meet at a
point F, <i>further from the mirror</i> than the focal
point of parallel rays. If the distance of the radiant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
or object D, be equal to the radius CE,
then will the focal distance be likewise equal to
the radius: That is, if an object be placed in the
center of a concave speculum, the image will be
reflected upon the object, or they will seem to
meet and embrace each other in the centre. If
the distance of the radiant be equal to half the
radius, its image will be reflected to an infinite
distance, for the rays will then be parallel. If,
therefore, a luminous body be placed at half the
radius from a concave speculum, it will enlighten
places directly before it at great distances. Hence
their use when placed behind a candle in a common
lantern; hence their utility in throwing light upon
objects in the Magic Lantern and Phantasmagoria,
and hence the vast importance of very large mirrors
of this description, as now used in most of
our Light Houses, for throwing a brilliant light to
great distances at sea to guide the mariner when
directing his course under the cloud of night.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 21.</i></p>
<img id="fig021" src="images/fig021.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When <i>converging</i> rays fall upon a concave mirror,
they are reflected more converging and unite
at a point between the focus of parallel rays and
the mirror; that is, nearer the mirror than one
half the radius; and their precise degree of convergency
will be greater than that wherein they
converged before reflection.</p>

<h5><i>Of the images formed by Concave Mirrors.</i></h5>

<p>If rays proceeding from a distant object fall upon
a concave speculum, they will paint an image or
representation of the object on its focus <i>before</i> the
mirror. This image will be inverted, because the
rays cross at the points where the image is formed.
We have already seen that a convex glass forms
an image of an object <i>behind</i> it; the rays of light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
from objects <i>pass through</i> the glass, and the picture
is formed on the side farthest from the object.
But in concave mirrors the images of distant objects&mdash;and
of all objects that are farther from its
surface than its principal focus&mdash;are formed <i>before</i>
the mirror, or on the same side as the object. In
almost every other respect, however, the effect of
a concave mirror is the same as that of a convex
lens, in regard to the formation of images, and the
course pursued by the rays of light, except that
the effect is produced in the one case by refraction,
and in the other by reflection. The following
figure represents the manner in which images are
formed by concave mirrors. GF represents the
reflecting surface of the mirror; OAB, the object;
and I<small>A</small>M, the image formed by the mirror.
The rays proceeding from O, will be carried to
the mirror, in the direction OG, and according to
the law that the angle of incidence is equal to
the angle of reflection, will be reflected to I, in
the direction GI. In like manner the rays
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
from B, will be reflected from F to M, the
rays from A, will be reflected to a, and so of
all the intermediate rays, so that an inverted image
of the object OB, will be formed at IM. If the
rays proceeded from objects at a very great distance
the image would be formed in the real focus
of the mirror, or at one-fourth the diameter of the
sphere from its surface; but near objects, which
send forth diverging rays, will have their images
formed a little farther from the surface of the
mirror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 22.</i></p>
<img id="fig022" src="images/fig022.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If we suppose a real object placed at IM, then
OB will represent its magnified image, which will
be larger than the object, in proportion to its distance
from the mirror. This may be experimentally
illustrated by a concave mirror and a candle.
Suppose a concave mirror whose focal distance is
five inches, and that a candle is placed before it,
at a little beyond its focus, (as at IM)&mdash;suppose
at five and a half inches,&mdash;and that a wall or white
screen receives the image, at the distance of five
feet six inches from the mirror, an image of the
candle will be formed on the wall which will be
twelve times longer and broader than the candle
itself. In this way concave mirrors may be made
to magnify the images of objects to an indefinite
extent. This experiment is an exact counterpart
of what is effected in similar circumstances by a
convex lens, as described p. 74; the mirror performing
the same thing by reflection, as the lens
did by refraction.</p>

<p>From what has been stated in relation to concave
mirrors it will be easily understood how they
make such powerful burning-glasses. Suppose the
focal distance of a concave mirror to be twelve
inches, and its diameter or breadth twelve inches.
When the sun’s rays fall on such a mirror, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
form an image of the sun at the focal point whose
diameter is found to be about one-tenth of an inch.
All the rays which fall upon the mirror are converged
into this small point; and consequently
their intensity is in proportion as the square of the
surface of the mirror is to the square of the image.
The squares of these diameters are as 14,400 to 1;
and consequently the density of the sun’s rays, in
the focus, is to their density on the surface of the
mirror as 14,400 to 1. That is, the heat of the
solar rays in the focus of such a mirror will be
fourteen thousand four hundred times greater than
before&mdash;a heat which is capable of producing very
powerful effects in melting and setting fire to substances
of almost every description.</p>

<p>Were we desirous of forming an image by a
concave speculum which shall be exactly equal to
the object, the object must be placed exactly in
the centre; and, by an experiment of this kind,
the centre of the concavity of a mirror may be
found.</p>

<p>In the cases now stated, the images of objects
are all formed in the front of the mirror, or between
it and the object. But there is a case in
which the image is formed behind the mirror.
This happens when the object is placed between
the mirror and the focus of parallel rays, and then
the image is larger than the object. In fig. 23,
GF is a concave mirror, whose focus of parallel
rays is at E. If an object OB be placed a little
within this focus, as at A, a large image IM will
be seen <i>behind</i> the mirror, somewhat curved and
erect, which will be seen by an eye looking directly
into the front of the mirror. Here the image appears
at a greater distance behind the mirror than
the object is before it, and the object appears magnified
in proportion to its distance from the focus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
and the mirror. If the mirror be one inch focal
distance, and the object be placed eight-tenths of
an inch from its surface, the image would be five
times as large as the object in length and breadth,
and consequently twenty-five times larger in surface.
In this way small objects may be magnified
by reflection, as such objects are magnified by refraction,
in the case of deep convex lenses. When
such mirrors are large, for example six inches diameter,
and eight or ten inches focal distance, they
exhibit the human face as of an enormous bulk.
This is illustrated by the following figure. Let
<small>C N</small>, Fig. 24, represent the surface of a concave
mirror, and A a human face looking into it, the
face will appear magnified as represented by the
image behind the mirror <small>D Q</small>. Suppose a ray <small>A C</small>
proceeding from the forehead, and another <small>M N</small>
from the chin; these rays are reflected to the person’s
eye at <small>O</small>, which consequently sees the image
in the lines of reflection <small>O D</small>, <small>O Q</small>, and in the angle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
<small>D O Q</small>, and consequently magnified much beyond
the natural size, and at a small distance behind the
mirror.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 23.</i></p>
<img id="fig023" src="images/fig023.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 24.</i></p>
<img id="fig024" src="images/fig024.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If we suppose the side <small>T U</small> to represent a <i>convex</i>
mirror, and the figure <small>D Q</small> a head of an ordinary
size, then the figure A will represent the diminished
appearance which a person’s face exhibits,
when viewed in such a mirror. It will not only
appear reduced, but somewhat distorted; because
from the form of the mirror, one part of the object
is nearer to it than another, and consequently will
be reflected under a different angle.</p>

<p>The effect we have now mentioned as produced
by <i>concave</i> mirrors, will only take place when the
eye is nearer the mirror than its principal focus.
If the spectator retire beyond this focus&mdash;suppose
to the distance of five or six feet, he will not see
the image <i>behind</i> the mirror; but he will see his
image in a diminished form, hanging upside down,
and suspended in the air, in a line between his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
eye and the mirror. In this case, his image is
formed <i>before</i> the mirror as represented at IM
fig. 22. In this situation, if you hold out your
hand towards the mirror, the hand of the image
will come out towards your hand, and, when at the
centre of concavity, it will be of an equal size with
it, and you may shake hands with this aerial
image. If you move your hand farther, you will
find the hand of the image pass by your hand, and
come between it and your body. If you move
your hand towards either side, the hand of the
image will move towards the other side; the image
moving always in a contrary direction to the object.
All this while the by-standers, if any, see
nothing of the image, because none of the reflected
rays that form it can enter their eyes.&mdash;The following
figure represents a phenomenon produced
in the same manner. <small>A B</small> is a concave mirror of a
large size; <small>C</small> represents a hand presented before
the mirror, at a point farther distant than its focus.
In this case, an inverted image of the hand is
formed which is seen hanging in the air at <small>M</small>. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
rays <small>C</small> and <small>D</small> go diverging from the two opposite
points of the object, and by the action of the
mirror, they are again made to converge to points
at <small>O</small> and <small>S</small> where they cross, form an image, and
again proceed divergent to the eye.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the properties of concave
mirrors, now described, many curious experiments
and optical deceptions have been exhibited. The
appearance of images in the air, suspended between
the mirror and the object, have sometimes been
displayed with such dexterity and an air of mystery,
as to have struck with astonishment those
who were ignorant of the cause. In this way
birds, flying angels, spectres and other objects have
been exhibited, and when the hand attempts to
lay hold on them, it finds them to be nothing, and
they seem to vanish into air. An apple or a beautiful
flower is presented, and when a spectator
attempts to touch it, it instantly vanishes, and a
death’s head immediately appears, and seems to
snap at his fingers. A person with a drawn sword
appears before him, in an attitude as if about to
run him through, or one terrific phantom starts
up after another, or sometimes the resemblances of
deceased persons are made to appear, as if, by the
art of conjuration, they had been forced to return
from the world of spirits. In all such exhibitions,
a very large concave mirror is requisite, a brilliant
light must be thrown upon the objects, and every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
arrangement is made, by means of partitions, &amp;c.,
to prevent either the light, the mirror, or the object
from being seen by the spectators. The following
representation (fig. 26.) shows one of the
methods by which this is effected: <small>A</small> is a large
concave mirror, either of metal or of glass, placed
on the back part of a dark box, <small>D</small> is the performer,
concealed from the spectators by the cross partition
<small>C</small>; <small>E</small> is a strong light, which is likewise concealed
by the partition <small>I</small>, which is thrown upon the
actor <small>D</small>, or upon any thing he may hold in his
hand. If he hold a book, as represented in the
figure, the light reflected from it will pass between
the partitions <small>C</small> and <small>I</small> to the mirror, and will be
reflected from thence to <small>Z</small>, where the image of the
book will appear so distinct and tangible, that a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
spectator looking through the opening at X, will
imagine that it is in his power to take hold of it.
In like manner, the person situated at <small>D</small>, may exhibit
his own head or body&mdash;a portrait, a painting,
a spectre, a landscape, or any object or device
which he can strongly illuminate.</p>

<p>There is another experiment, made with a concave
mirror, which has somewhat puzzled philosophers
to account for the phenomena. Take a
glass bottle AC, (fig. 27) and fill it with water to
the point B; leave the upper part BC empty, and
cork it in the common manner. Place this bottle
opposite a concave mirror, and beyond its focus,
that it may appear reversed, and, before the mirror
place yourself still further distant from the bottle,
and it will appear in the situation <small>A B C</small>. Now, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
is remarkable in this apparent bottle, that the
<i>water</i>, which, according to the laws of catoptrics,
should appear at <small>A B</small>, appears on the contrary at
<small>B C</small>, and consequently, the part <small>A B</small> appears empty.
If the bottle be inverted and placed before the
mirror, its image will appear in its natural erect
position, and the water which is in reality at BC
(fig. 28) is seen at <small>A B</small>. If while the bottle
is inverted, it be uncorked, and the water run
gently out, it will appear, that, while the part BC
is <i>emptying</i>, that of <small>A B</small> in the image is filling,
and, what is remarkable, as soon as the bottle is
empty, the illusion ceases, the image also appearing
entirely empty.&mdash;The remarkable circumstances
in this experiment are, first, not only to see the
object where it is not, but also where its <i>image</i> is
not; and secondly, that of two objects which are
really in the same place, as the surface of the
bottle and the water it contains, the one is seen at
one place, and the other at another; and to see
the bottle in the place of its image, and the water
where neither it nor its image are.</p>

<p>The following experiments are stated by Mr.
Ferguson in his “Lectures on select Subjects,” &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>“If a fire be made in a large room, and a smooth
mahogany table be placed at a good distance near
the wall, before a large concave mirror, so placed
that the light of the fire may be reflected from the
mirror to its focus upon the table; if a person
stand by the table, he will see nothing upon it but
a longish beam of light: but if he stand at a distance
toward the fire, not directly between the fire
and mirror, he will see an image of the fire upon
the table, large and erect. And if another person
who knows nothing of the matter beforehand
should chance to come into the room, and should
look from the fire toward the table, he would be

startled at the appearance; for the table would
seem to be on fire, and by being near the wainscot,
to endanger the whole house. In this experiment
there should be no light in the room but what proceeds
from the fire; and the mirror ought to be at
least fifteen inches in diameter. If the fire be
darkened by a screen, and a large candle be placed
at the back of the screen, a person standing by the
candle will see the appearance of a very fine large
star, or rather planet, upon the table, as bright as
Venus or Jupiter. And if a small wax taper&mdash;whose
flame is much less than the flame of the
candle&mdash;be placed near the candle, a satellite to
the planet will appear on the table; and if the
taper be moved round the candle, the satellite will
go round the planet.”</p>

<p>Many other illustrations of the effects of concave
specula might have been given, but I shall conclude
this department by briefly stating some of
the <i>general properties of speculums</i>.</p>

<p>1. There is a great resemblance between the
properties of <i>convex</i> lenses and <i>concave</i> mirrors.
They both form an inverted focal image of any remote
object, by the convergence of the pencil of
rays. In those instruments whose performances
are the effects of reflection, as reflecting telescopes,
the concave mirror is substituted in the place of
the convex lens. The whole effect of these instruments,
in bringing to view remote objects in heaven
and on earth, entirely depends on the property
of a concave mirror in forming <i>images</i> of objects
in its focus. 2. The image of an object placed
beyond the centre, is less than the object; if the
object be placed between the principal focus and
the centre, the image is greater than the object.
In both cases the image is inverted. 3. When
the object is placed between the focus and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
mirror, the image situated <i>behind</i> the mirror is
greater than the object, and it has the same direction:
in proportion as the object approaches the
focus, the image becomes larger and more distant.
These and similar results are proved by placing a
lighted candle at different distances from a concave
mirror. 4. An eye cannot see an image in the
air except it be placed in the diverging rays; but
if the image be received on a piece of white paper,
it may be seen in any position of the eye, as the
rays are then reflected in every direction. 5. If a
picture drawn according to the rules of perspective,
be placed before a large concave speculum, a
little nearer than its principal focus, the image of
the picture will appear extremely natural, and very
nearly like the real objects whence it was taken.
Not only are the objects considerably magnified,
so as to approach to their natural size, but they
have also different apparent distances, as in nature,
so that the view of the inside of a church appears
very like what it is in reality, and representations
of landscapes appear very nearly, as they do from
the spot whence they were taken. In this respect
a large concave speculum may be made to serve
nearly the same purpose, as the Optical Diagonal
Machine, in viewing perspective prints. 6. The
concave speculum is that alone which is used as
the great mirror which forms the first image in reflecting
telescopes; and it is likewise the only kind
of speculum used as the small mirror, in that construction
of the instrument called the <i>Gregorian
Reflector</i>.</p>

<h5><i>Quantity of light reflected by polished surfaces.</i></h5>

<p>As this is a circumstance connected with the
construction of reflecting telescopes, it may not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
improper, in this place, to state some of the results
of the accurate experiments of M. Bonguer on
this subject. This philosopher ascertained that of
the light reflected from mercury, or quicksilver,
more than <i>one-fourth</i> is lost, though it is probable
that no substances reflect more light than this.
The rays were received at an angle of eleven and
a half degrees of incidence, measured from the surface
of the reflecting body, and not from the perpendicular.
The reflection from <i>water</i> was found
to be almost as great as that of quicksilver; so
that in very small angles it reflects nearly three-fourths
of the direct light. This is the reason why
so strong a reflection appears on water, when one
walks, in still weather, on the brink of a lake opposite
to the sun. The direct light of the sun
diminishes gradually as it approaches the horizon,
while the reflected light at the same time grows
stronger; so that there is a certain elevation of
the sun in which the united force of the direct and
reflected light will be the greatest possible, and
this is when he is twelve or thirteen degrees in
altitude. On the other hand, light reflected from
water at <i>great angles</i> of incidence is extremely
small. When the light was perpendicular, it reflected
no more than the thirty-seventh part which
mercury does in the same circumstances, and only
the fifty-fifth part of what fell upon it in this case.</p>

<p>Using a smooth piece of glass, one line in thickness,
he found that, when it was placed at an
angle of fifteen degrees with the incident rays, it
reflected 628 parts of 1000 which fell upon it; at
the same time, a metallic mirror which he tried in
the same circumstances, reflected only 561 of them.
At a less angle of incidence much more light was
reflected; so that at an angle of three degrees, the
glass reflected 700 parts, and the metal something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
less, as in the former case. The most striking observations
made by this experimenter relate to the
very great difference in the quantity of light reflected
at different angles of incidence. He found
that for 1000 incident rays, the reflected rays, at
different angles of incidence, were as follows.</p>

<p>With regard to such mirrors as the specula of
reflecting telescopes, it will be found, in general,
that they reflect little more than the <i>one half</i> of
the rays which fall upon them.</p>

<h4 id="UNCOMMON_APPEARANCES_IN_NATURE_PRODUCED"><i>Uncommon appearances in nature produced by
the combined influences of Reflection and Refraction.</i></h4>

<p>The reflection and refraction of the rays of light
frequently produce phenomena which astonish the
beholders, and which have been regarded by the
ignorant and the superstitious, as the effects of
supernatural agency. Of these phenomena I shall
state a few examples.</p>

<p>One of the most striking appearances of this kind
is what has been termed the <i>Fata Morgana</i>, or
optical appearances of figures in the sea and the
air, as seen in the Faro of Messina. The following
account is translated from a work of Minasi,
who witnessed the phenomenon, and wrote a dissertation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
on the subject. “When the rising sun
shines from that point whence its incident ray forms
an angle of about forty-five degrees to the sea of
Riggio, and the bright surface of the water in the
bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the current,
the spectator being placed on an eminence of
the city, with his back to the sun and his face to
the sea;&mdash;on a sudden there appear on the water,
as in a catoptric theatre, various multiplied objects,
that is to say, numberless series of pilasters, arches,
castles well delineated, regular columns, lofty
towers, superb palaces, with balconies and windows,
extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with
herds and flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback,
and many other strange images, in their natural
colours and proper actions, passing rapidly
in succession along the surface of the sea, during
the whole of the short period of time, while the
above mentioned causes remain.&mdash;But, if in addition
to the circumstances now described, the atmosphere
be highly impregnated with vapour and
dense exhalations, not previously dispersed by the
winds or the sun, it then happens that, in this
vapour, as in a curtain extended along the channel,
at the height of about thirty palms, and nearly
down to the sea, the observer will behold the scene
of the same objects, not only reflected from the
surface of the sea, but likewise in the air, though
not so distant or well defined, as the former objects
from the sea.&mdash;Lastly, if the air be slightly hazy
or opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted
to form the iris, the then above-mentioned objects
will appear only at the surface of the sea,
as in the first case, but all vividly coloured or
fringed with red, green, blue and other prismatic
colours.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to account for all the
appearances here described; but, in all probability,
they are produced by a calm sea, and one or more
strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive
and consequently in reflective power. At any rate
reflection and refraction are some of the essential
causes which operate in the production of the
phenomena.</p>

<p>The <i>Mirage</i>, seen in the deserts of Africa, is a
phenomenon, in all probability produced by a
similar cause. M. Monge, who accompanied the
French army to Egypt, relates that, when in the
desert between Alexandria and Cairo, the mirage
of the blue sky was inverted, and so mingled with
the sand below, as to give to the desolate and arid
wilderness an appearance of the most rich and
beautiful country. They saw, in all directions,
green islands, surrounded with extensive lakes of
pure, transparent water. Nothing could be conceived
more lovely and picturesque than the landscape.
In the tranquil surface of the lakes, the
trees and houses with which the islands were covered,
were strongly reflected with vivid and varied
hues, and the party hastened forward to enjoy the
cool refreshments of shade and stream which these
populous villages proffered to them. When they
arrived, the lake on whose bosom they floated, the
trees among whose foliage they were embowered,
and the people who stood on the shore inviting
their approach, had all vanished, and nothing remained
but an uniform and irksome desert of sand
and sky, with a few naked huts and ragged Arabs.
Had they not been undeceived by their nearer approach,
there was not a man in the French army
who would not have sworn that the visionary trees
and lakes had a real existence in the midst of the
desert.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Dr. Clark observed precisely the same appearances
at Rosetta. The city seemed surrounded
with a beautiful sheet of water; and so certain
was his Greek interpreter&mdash;who was unacquainted
with the country&mdash;of this fact, that he was quite
indignant at an Arab who attempted to explain to
him that it was a mere optical delusion. At
length they reached Rosetta in about two hours,
without meeting with any water; and on looking
back on the sand they had just crossed, it seemed
to them as if they had waded through a vast blue
lake.</p>

<p>On the 1st of August, 1798, Dr. Vince observed
at Ramsgate a ship which appeared as at <small>A</small>, (fig.
29.) the topmast being the only part of it that
was seen above the horizon. An inverted image
of it was seen at <small>B</small>, immediately above the real
ship <small>A</small>, and an erect image at <small>C</small>, both of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
being complete and well defined. The sea was distinctly
seen between them, as at <small>V W</small>. As the ship
rose to the horizon the image <small>C</small> gradually disappeared,
and while this was going on, the image <small>B</small>
descended, but the mainmast of <small>B</small> did not meet
the mainmast of <small>A</small>. The two images <small>BC</small> were
perfectly visible when the whole ship was actually
below the horizon. Dr. Vince then directed his
telescope to another ship whose hull was just in
the horizon, and he observed a complete inverted
image of it, the mainmast of which just touched
the mainmast of the ship itself. He saw at the
same time several other ships whose images appeared
in nearly a similar manner, in one of
which the two images were visible when the whole
ship was beneath the horizon. These phenomena
must have been produced by the same causes
which operated in the case formerly mentioned,
in relation to Captain Scoresby, when he saw the
figure of his father’s ship inverted in the distant
horizon. Such cases are, perhaps not uncommon,
especially in calm and sultry weather, but they
are seldom observed, except when a person’s attention
is accidentally directed to the phenomenon,
and, unless he use a telescope, it will not be so
distinctly perceived.</p>

<p>The following phenomenon, of a description
nearly related to the above, has been supposed to
be chiefly owing to <i>reflection</i>. On the 18th of
November, 1804, Dr. Buchan, when watching the
rising sun, about a mile to the east of Brighton,
just as the solar disk emerged from the surface of
the water, saw the face of the cliff on which he
was standing, a windmill, his own figure and
the figure of his friend, distinctly represented,
precisely opposite, at some distance from the
ocean. This appearance lasted about ten minutes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
till the sun had risen nearly his own diameter
above the sea. The whole then seemed to be
elevated into the air and successively disappeared.
The surface of the sun was covered with a dense
fog of many yards in height, which gradually
receded from the rays of the sun as he ascended
from the horizon.</p>

<p>The following appearance most probably arose
chiefly from the <i>refraction</i> of the atmosphere. It
was beheld at Ramsgate, by Dr. Vince of Cambridge
and another gentleman. It is well known
that the four turrets of Dover castle are seen at
Ramsgate, over a hill which intervenes between a
full prospect of the whole. On the 2nd of August,
1806, not only were the four turrets visible, but
the castle itself appeared as though situated on
that side of the hill nearest Ramsgate, and so
striking was the appearance, that for a long time
the Doctor thought it an illusion; but at last, by
accurate observation, was convinced that it was an
actual image of the castle. He, with another individual,
observed it attentively for twenty minutes,
but were prevented by rain from making further
observations. Between the observers and the land
from which the hill rises, there were about six
miles of sea, and from thence to the top of the hill
there was about the same distance, their own
height above the surface of the water was about
seventy feet.&mdash;The cause of this phenomenon was,
undoubtedly, <i>unequal refraction</i>. The air being
more dense near the ground and above the sea
than at greater heights, reached the eye of the
observer, not in straight but in curvilinear lines.
If the rays from the castle had in their path struck
an eye at a much greater distance than Ramsgate,
the probability is, that the image of the castle
would have been inverted in the air; but in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
present case,the rays from the turret and the base
of the castle had not crossed each other.</p>

<p>To similar causes as those now alluded to are to
be attributed such phenomena as the following:</p>

<p><i>The Spectre of the Brocken.</i> This is a wonderful
and, at first sight, a terrific phenomenon, which
is sometimes seen from the summit of one of the
Hartz mountains in Hanover, which is about
3,300 feet above the level of the sea, and overlooks
all the country fifteen miles round. From this
mountain the most gigantic and terrific spectres
have been seen, which have terrified the credulous,
and gratified the curious, in a very high degree.
M. Haw&eacute; who witnessed this phenomenon, says,
the sun rose about four o’clock, after he had ascended
to the summit, in a serene sky, free of
clouds; and about a quarter past five, when looking
round to see if the sky continued clear, he
suddenly beheld at a little distance, a human figure
of <i>a monstrous size</i> turned towards him, and glaring
at him. While gazing on this gigantic spectre,
with a mixture of awe and apprehension, a sudden
gust of wind nearly carried off his hat, and he
clapt his hand to his head to detain it, when to
his great delight, the colossal spectre did the
same. He changed his body into a variety of
attitudes,all which the spectre exactly imitated, and
then suddenly vanished without any apparent
cause, and, in a short time as suddenly appeared.
Being joined by another spectator, after the first
visions had disappeared, they kept steadily looking
for the a&euml;rial spectres, when two gigantic monsters
suddenly appeared. These spectres had been
long considered as preternatural, by the inhabitants
of the adjacent districts, and the whole
country had been filled with awe and terror. Some
of the lakes of Ireland are found to be susceptible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of producing illusions, particularly the lake of
<i>Killarney</i>. This romantic sheet of water is
bounded on one side, by a semicircle of rugged
mountains, and on the other by a flat morass;
and the vapours generated in the marsh, and
broken by the mountains, continually represent
the most fantastic objects. Frequently men riding
along the shore are seen as if they were moving
across the lake, which is supposed to have given
rise to the legend of O’Donougho, a magician who
is said to be visible on the lake every May morning.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that most of those
visionary appearances which have been frequently
seen in the sky and in mountainous regions, are
phantoms produced by the cause to which I am
adverting, such as armies of footmen and horsemen,
which some have asserted to have been seen
in the air near the horizon. A well authenticated
instance of this kind occurred in the Highlands of
Scotland:&mdash;Mr. Wren of Wetton Hall, and D.
Stricket his servant, in the year 1744, were sitting
at the door of the house in a summer evening,
when they were surprised to see opposite to them
on the side of Sonterfell hill&mdash;a place so extremely
steep, that scarce a horse could <i>walk</i> slowly along
it&mdash;the figure of a man with a dog pursuing
several horses, all running at a most rapid pace.
Onwards they passed till at last they disappeared
at the lower end of the Fell. In expectation
of finding the man dashed to pieces by so
tremendous a fall, they went early next morning
and made a search, but no trace of man or horse,
or the prints of their feet on the turf could be
found. Sometime afterwards, about seven in the
evening, on the same spot, they beheld a troop of
horsemen advancing in close ranks and at a brisk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
pace. The inmates of every cottage for a mile
round beheld the wondrous scene, though they
had formerly ridiculed the story told by Mr. Wren
and his servant, and were struck with surprise and
fear. The figures were seen for upwards of two
hours, till the approach of darkness rendered
them invisible. The various evolutions and
changes through which the troops passed were
distinctly visible, and were marked by all the
observers. It is not improbable that these a&euml;rial
troopers were produced by the same cause which
made the castle of Dover to appear on the side
of the hill next to Ramsgate, and it is supposed
that they were the images of a body of rebels, on
the other side of the hill, exercising themselves
previous to the rebellion in 1745.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>I shall mention only another instance of this
description which lately occurred in France, and
for a time caused a powerful sensation among all
ranks. On Sunday the 17th of December, 1826,
the clergy in the parish of Mign&eacute;, in the vicinity
of Poictiers, were engaged in the exercises of the
Jubilee which preceded the festival of Christmas,
and a number of persons to the amount of 3000
souls assisted in the service. They had planted
as part of the ceremony, a large cross, twenty-five
feet high, and painted red, in the open air beside
the church. While one of the preachers, about
five in the evening, was addressing the multitude,
he reminded them of the miraculous cross which
appeared in the sky to Constantine and his army,
and the effect it produced&mdash;when suddenly a
similar celestial cross appeared in the heavens just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
before the porch of the church about 200 feet
above the horizon, and 140 feet in length, and its
breadth from three to four feet, of a bright silver
colour tinged with red. The curate and congregation
fixed their wondering gaze upon this extraordinary
phenomenon, and the effect produced
on the minds of the assembly was strong and
solemn: they spontaneously threw themselves on
their knees; and many, who had been remiss in
their religious duties, humbly confessed their sins,
and made vows of penance and reformation. A
commission was appointed to investigate the truth
of this extraordinary appearance, and a memorial
stating the above and other facts was subscribed
by more than forty persons of rank and intelligence,
so that no doubt was entertained as to the
reality of the phenomenon. By many it was
considered as strictly miraculous, as having happened
at the time and in the circumstances mentioned.
But it is evident, from what we have
already stated, that it may be accounted for on
physical principles. The large cross of wood
painted red was doubtless the real object which
produced the magnified image. The state of the
atmosphere, according to the descriptions given in
the memorial, must have been favourable for the
production of such images. The spectrum of the
wooden cross must have been cast on the concave
surface of some atmospheric mirror, and so reflected
back to the eyes of the spectators, from an
opposite place&mdash;retaining exactly the same shape
and proportions, but dilated in size; and what is
worthy of attention, it was tinged with red, the
very colour of the object of which it was the reflected
image.</p>

<p>Such phenomena as we have now described, and
the causes of them which science is able to unfold,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
are worthy of consideration, in order to divest the
mind of superstitious terrors, and enable it clearly
to perceive the laws by which the Almighty directs
the movements of the material system. When
any appearance in nature, exactly the reverse of
every thing we could have previously conceived&mdash;presents
itself to view, and when we know of no
material cause by which it could be produced, the
mind must feel a certain degree of awe and terror,
and will naturally resort to supernatural agency
as acting either in opposition to the established
laws of the universe, or beyond the range to which
they are confined. Besides the fears and apprehensions
to which such erroneous conceptions give
rise, they tend to convey false and distorted impressions
of the attributes of the Deity and of
his moral government. Science, therefore, performs
an invaluable service to man, by removing the
cause of superstitious alarms, by investigating the
laws and principles which operate in the physical
system, and by assigning reasons for those occasional
phenomena, which at first sight appeared
beyond the range of the operation of natural
causes.</p>

<p>The late ingenious Dr. Wollaston illustrated
the causes of some of the phenomena we have
described, in the following manner. He looked
along the side of a red hot poker at a word or
object ten or twelve feet distant; and at a distance
less than three eights of an inch from the
line of the poker, an <i>inverted</i> image was seen, and
within and without that image, an <i>erect</i> image, in
consequence of the change produced, by the heat
of the poker, in the density of the air. He also
suggested the following experiment as another
illustration of the same principle, namely, viewing
an object through a stratum of spirit of wine lying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
above water, or a stratum of water laid above one
of syrup. He poured into a <i>square</i> phial a small
quantity of clear syrup, and above this he poured
an equal quantity of <i>water</i> which gradually combined
with the syrup, as seen at A. fig. 30. The
word ‘Syrup,’ on a card held behind the bottle,
appeared erect when seen through the pure spirit,
but inverted, when seen through the mixture of
water and syrup. He afterwards put nearly the
same quantity of rectified spirits of wine above
the water, as seen at B, and he saw the appearance
as represented, namely, the true place of the word
‘Spirit,’ and the inverted and erect images below.
These substances, by their gradual incorporation,
produce refracting power, diminishing from the
<i>spirit of wine</i> to the <i>water</i>, or from the <i>syrup</i> to the
<i>water</i>; so that by looking through the mixed stratum,
an inverted image of any object is seen behind
the bottle. These experiments show that the
<i>mirage</i> and several other atmospherical phenomena
may be produced by variations in the refractive
power of different strata of the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>It is not unlikely that phenomena of a new and
different description from any we have hitherto
observed, may be produced from the same causes
to which we have adverted. A certain optical
writer remarks&mdash;‘If the variation of the refractive
power of the air takes place in a horizontal
line perpendicular to the line of vision, that is,
from right to left, then we may have a <i>lateral</i>
Mirage, that is, an image of a ship may be seen
on the right or left hand of the real ship, or on
both, if the variation of refractive power is the
same on each side of the line of vision, and a fact
of this kind was once observed on the Lake of
Geneva. If there should happen at the same
time, both a vertical and a lateral variation of
refractive power in the air, and if the variation
should be such as to expand or elongate the object
in both directions, then the object would be magnified
as if seen through a telescope, and might be
seen and recognized at a distance at which it
would not otherwise have been visible. If the
refracting power, on the contrary, varied, so as to
construct the object in both directions, the image
of it would be diminished as if seen through a
concave lens.’</p>

<h4 id="REMARKS_AND_REFLECTIONS_IN_REFERENCE_TO_THE_PHENOMENA_DESCRIBED_ABOVE"><i>Remarks and Reflections, in reference to the
phenomena described above.</i></h4>

<p>Such, then, are some of the striking and interesting
effects produced by the refraction and
the reflection of the rays of light. As the formation
of the <i>images</i> of objects by convex lenses,
lays the foundation of the construction of refracting
telescopes and microscopes, and of all the
discoveries they have brought to light, so the
property of <i>concave specula</i>, in forming similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
images, is that on which the construction of
<i>Reflecting</i> telescopes entirely depends. To this
circumstance Herschel was indebted for the
powerful telescopes he was enabled to construct&mdash;which
were all formed on the principle of reflection&mdash;and
for all the discoveries they enabled him
to make in the planetary system, and in the sidereal
heavens. The same principles which operate
in optical instruments, under the agency of man,
we have reason to believe, frequently act on a
more expansive scale in various parts of the system
of nature. The magnificent <i>Cross</i> which astonished
the preacher and the immense congregation
assembled at Mign&eacute;, was, in all probability, formed
by a vast atmospherical speculum formed by the
hand of nature, and representing its objects on a
scale far superior to that of human art; and probably,
to the same cause is to be attributed the
singular phenomenon of the coast of France having
been made to appear within two or three miles of
the town of Hastings, as formerly described, (see
p. 53.) Many other phenomena which we have
never witnessed, and of which we can form no
conception, may be produced by the same cause
operating in an infinity of modes.</p>

<p>The facts we have stated above, and the variety
of modes by which light may be refracted and
reflected by different substances in nature, lead us
to form some conceptions of the magnificent and
diversified scenes which light may produce in
other systems and worlds, under the arrangements
of the all-wise and Beneficent Creator. Light, in
all its modifications and varieties of colour and
reflection, may be considered as the beauty and
glory of the universe, and the source of unnumbered
enjoyments to all its inhabitants. It is a
symbol of the Divinity himself; for “<span class="smcap">God is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
Light</span>, and in Him is no darkness at all.” It is
a representative of Him who is exhibited in the
Sacred oracles, as “The <span class="smcap">Sun</span> of Righteousness,”
and “the <span class="smcap">Light</span> of the world.” It is an emblem
of the glories and felicities of that future world,
where knowledge shall be perfected, and happiness
complete; for its inhabitants are designated “the
saints in <i>light</i>;” and it is declared in Sacred history,
to have been the first born of created beings.
In our lower world, its effects on the objects which
surround us, and its influences upon all sensitive
beings, are multifarious and highly admirable.
While passing from infinitude to infinitude, it
reveals the depth and immensity of the heavens,
the glory of the sun, the beauty of the stars, the
arrangements of the planets, the rainbow encompassing
the sky with its glorious circle, the
embroidery of flowers, the rich clothing of the
meadows, the valleys standing thick with corn,
“the cattle on a thousand hills,” the rivers rolling
through the plains, and the wide expanse of the
ocean. But in other worlds the scenes it creates
may be far more resplendent and magnificent.
This may depend upon the refractive and reflective
powers with which the Creator has endowed
the atmospheres of other planets, and the peculiar
constitution of the various objects with which
they are connected. It is evident, from what we
already know of the reflection of light, that very
slight modifications of certain physical principles,
and very slight additions to the arrangements of
our terrestrial system, might produce scenes of
beauty, magnificence and splendour of which, at
present, we can form no conception. And, it is
not unlikely that by such diversities of arrangement,
in other worlds, <i>an infinite variety</i> of natural
scenery is produced throughout the universe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>In the arrangements connected with the planet
Saturn, and the immense rings with which it is
encompassed, and in the various positions which
its satellites daily assume with regard to one
another, to the planet itself, and to these rings&mdash;there
is, in all probability, a combination of refractions,
reflections, light, and shadows, which
produce scenes wonderfully diversified, and surpassing
in grandeur what we can now distinctly
conceive. In the remote regions of the heavens,
there are certain bodies composed of immense
masses of luminous matter, not yet formed into
any regular system, and which are known by the
name of <i>Nebul&aelig;</i>. What should hinder us from
supposing that certain exterior portions of those
masses form speculums of enormous size, as some
parts of our atmosphere are sometimes found to
do? Such specula may be conceived to be hundreds
and even thousands of miles in diameter, and
that they may form images of the most distant
objects in the heavens, on a scale of immense
magnitude and extent, and which may be reflected,
in all their grandeur, to the eyes of intelligences at
a vast distance. And, if the organs of vision of
such beings, be far superior to ours in acuteness
and penetrating power, they may thus be enabled
to take a survey of an immense sphere of vision,
and to descry magnificent objects at distances the
most remote from the sphere they occupy. Whatever
grounds there may be for such suppositions,
it must be admitted, that all the knowledge we
have hitherto acquired respecting the operation of
light, and the splendid effects it is capable of producing,
is small indeed, and limited to a narrow
circle, compared with the immensity of its range,
the infinite modifications it may undergo, and the
wondrous scenes it may create in regions of creation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to which human eyes have never yet penetrated,&mdash;and
which may present to view objects of
brilliancy and magnificence such as, “Eye hath
not yet seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered
into the heart of man to conceive.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<h3 id="PART_I_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4 id="ON_THE_COLOURS_OF_LIGHT">SECT. I.&mdash;ON THE COLOURS OF LIGHT.</h4>

<p>We have hitherto considered light chiefly as a
simple homogeneous substance, as if all its rays
were white, and as if they were all refracted in the
same manner by the different lenses on which
they fall. Investigations however, into the nature
of this wonderful fluid, have demonstrated that
this is not the case, and that it is possessed of
certain additional properties, of the utmost importance
in the system of nature. Had every ray of
light been a pure white, and incapable of being
separated into any other colours, the scene of the
universe would have exhibited a very different
aspect from what we now behold. One uniform
hue would have appeared over the whole face of
nature, and one object could scarcely have been
distinguished from another. The different shades
of verdure which now diversify every landscape, the
brilliant colouring of the flowery fields, and
almost all the beauties and sublimities which
adorn this lower creation would have been withdrawn.
But it is now ascertained that every ray
of white light is composed of an assemblage of
colours, whence proceed that infinite variety of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
shade and colour with which the whole of our
terrestrial habitation is arrayed. Those colours
are found not to be in the objects themselves, but
in the rays of light which fall upon them, without
which they would either be invisible, or wear an
uniform aspect. In reference to this point, Goldsmith
has well observed: ‘The blushing beauties
of the rose, the modest blue of the violet, are
not in the flowers themselves, but in the light
that adorns them. Odour, softness, and beauty
of figure are their own; but it is light alone that
dresses them up in those robes which shame the
monarch’s glory.’</p>

<p>Many strange opinions and hypotheses were
entertained respecting colours, by the ancients,
and even by many modern writers, prior to the
time of Sir Isaac Newton. The Pythagoreans
called colour the <i>superficies</i> of bodies; Plato said
that it was a flame issuing from them. According
to Zeno it is the first configuration of matter, and
according to Aristotle, it is that which moves
bodies actually transparent. Among the moderns,
Des Cartes imagined that the difference of colour
proceeds from the prevalence of the direct or
rotatory motions of the particles of light. Grimaldi,
Dechales, and others, thought the differences of
colour depended upon the quick or slow vibrations
of a certain elastic medium filling the whole
universe. Rohault imagined that the different
colours were made by the rays of light entering
the eye at different angles with respect to the
optic axis; and Dr. Hook conceived that colour
is caused by the sensation of the oblique or uneven
pulse of light; and this being capable of no more
than two varieties, he concluded that there could
be no more than two primary colours. Such
were some of the crude opinions which prevailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
before the era of the illustrious Newton, by whose
enlightened investigations the true theory of
colours was at last discovered. In the year 1666
this philosopher began to investigate the subject;
and finding the coloured image of the sun, formed
by a glass prism, to be of an oblong and not of a
circular form, as according to the laws of refraction
it ought to be, he was surprised at the great
disproportion between its length and breadth, the
former being <i>five</i> times the length of the latter;
and he began to conjecture that light is not <i>homogeneal</i>,
but that it consists of rays some of which
are much more refrangible than others. Prior to
this period, philosophers supposed that <i>all</i> light,
in passing out of one medium into another of
different density was <i>equally</i> refracted in the
same or like circumstances; but Newton discovered
that this is not the fact; but that there are
<i>different species</i> of light, and that each species is
disposed both to suffer a different degree of refrangibility
in passing out of one medium into
another,&mdash;and to excite in us the idea of a <i>different
colour</i> from the rest; and that bodies appear of
that colour which arises from the peculiar rays
they are disposed to reflect. It is now, therefore,
universally acknowledged, that the light of the sun,
which to us seems perfectly homogeneal and
white, is composed of no fewer than <i>seven</i> different
colours, namely <i>Red</i>, <i>Orange</i>, <i>Yellow</i>, <i>Green</i>,
<i>Blue</i>, <i>Indigo and Violet</i>. A body which appears
of a red colour has the property of reflecting the
red rays more powerfully than any of the others;
a body of a green colour reflects the green rays
more copiously than rays of any other colour, and
so of the orange, yellow, blue, purple and violet.
A body which is of a <i>black</i> colour, instead of reflecting&mdash;<i>absorbs</i>
all, or the greater part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
rays that fall upon it; and, on the contrary, a
body that appears <i>white</i> reflects the greater part
of the rays indiscriminately without separating the
one from the other.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the experiments
by which the above results were obtained, it may
be proper to give some idea of the form and effects
of the <i>Prism</i> by which such experiments are made.
This instrument is triangular and straight, and
generally about three or four inches long. It is
commonly made of white glass, as free as possible
from veins and bubbles, and other similar defects,
and is solid throughout. Its lateral faces, or sides,
should be perfectly plane and of a fine polish.
The angle formed by the two faces, one receiving
the ray of light that is refracted in the instrument,
and the other affording it an issue on its returning
into the air, is called the <i>refracting angle</i> of the
prism, as ACB, (fig. 31.) The manner in which
Newton performed his experiments, and established
the discovery to which we have alluded, is as follows.</p>

<p>In the window-shutter EG, (fig. 31.) of a dark
room, a hole F, was made, of about one third of
an inch diameter, and behind it was placed a glass
prism ACB, so that the beam of light, SF, proceeding
directly from the sun was made to pass
through the prism. Before the interposition of
the prism, the beam proceeded in a straight line
towards T, where it formed a round white spot;
but being now bent out of its course by the prism,
it formed an oblong image OP, upon the white
pasteboard, or screen LM, containing the seven
colours marked in the figure&mdash;the <i>red</i> being the
<i>least</i>, and the <i>violet</i> the <i>most</i> refracted from the
original direction of the solar beam, ST. This
oblong image is called the <i>prismatic spectrum</i>.
If the refracting angle of the prism ACB, be 64
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
degrees, and the distance of the pasteboard from
the prism about 18 feet, the length of the image
OP will be about 10 inches, and the breadth 2
inches. The sides of the spectrum are right
lines distinctly bounded, and the ends are semicircular.
From this circumstance it is evident
that it is still the image of the sun, but elongated
by the refractive power of the prism. It is evident
from the figure, that since some part of the
beam, RO, is refracted much further out of its
natural course WT, than some other part of the
beam, as WP, the rays towards RO have a much
greater disposition to be refracted than those
toward WP; and that this disposition arises from
the naturally different qualities of those rays, is
evident from this consideration, that the refracting
angle or power of the prism is the same in regard
to the superior part of the beam as to the inferior.</p>

<p>By making a hole in the screen LM opposite
any one of the colours of the spectrum, so as to
allow that colour alone to pass&mdash;and by letting
the colour thus separated fall upon a second
prism&mdash;Newton found that the light of each of
the colours was alike refrangible, because the
second prism could not separate them into an
oblong image, or into any other colour. Hence he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
called all the seven colours <i>simple</i> or homogeneous,
in opposition to <i>white</i> light, which he called <i>compound</i>
or heterogeneous. With the prism which
this philosopher used he found the lengths of the
colours and spaces of the spectrum to be as
follows: Red, 45; Orange, 27; Yellow, 40;
Green, 60; Blue, 60; Indigo, 48; Violet, 80:
or 360 in all. But these spaces vary a little with
prisms formed of different substances, and as they
are not separated by distinct limits, it is difficult
to obtain any thing like an accurate measure of
their relative extents. Newton examined the
ratio between the sines of incidence and refraction
of these decompounded rays (see p. 30,)
and found that each of the seven primary colour-making
rays, had certain limits within which they
were confined. Thus let the sine of incidence in
glass be divided into 50 equal parts, the sine of
refraction into air of the <i>least</i> refrangible, and
the <i>most</i> refrangible rays will contain respectively
77 and 78 such parts. The sines of refraction of
all the degrees of <i>red</i> will have the intermediate
degrees of magnitude, from 77 to 77 one-eighth;
<i>Orange</i> from 77 one-eighth to 77 one-fifth; <i>Yellow</i>
from 77 one-fifth to 77 one-third; <i>Green</i> from 77
one-third to 77 one-half; <i>Blue</i> from 77 one-half
to 77 two-thirds; <i>Indigo</i> from 77 two-thirds to 77
seven-ninths; and <i>Violet</i> from 77 seven-ninths to 78.</p>

<p>From what has been now stated, it is evident
that, in proportion as any part of an optic glass
bears a resemblance to the form of a prism, the
component rays that pass through it must be
necessarily separated, and will consequently paint
or tinge the object with colours. The edges of
every convex lens approach to this form, and it is
on this account that the extremities of objects
when viewed through them are found to be tinged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
with the prismatic colours. In such a glass, therefore,
those different coloured rays will have <i>different
foci</i>, and will form their respective images
at different distances from the lens. Thus, suppose
LN (fig. 32.) to represent a double convex-lens,
and OB an object at some distance from it.
If the object OB was of a pure red colour, the
rays proceeding from it would form a red image
at <span class="smcap">Rr</span>; if the object was of a violet colour, an
image of that colour would be formed at <span class="smcap">Vv</span>,
<i>nearer</i> the lens; and if the object was white or
any other combination of the colour-making rays,
those rays would have their respective foci at
different distances from the lens, and form a
succession of images, in the order of the prismatic
colours, between the space <span class="smcap">Rr</span> and <span class="smcap">Vv</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 32.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 33.</i></p>
<img id="fig033" src="images/fig033.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This may be illustrated by experiment in the
following manner. Take a card or slip of white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
pasteboard, as ABEF, (fig. 33.) and paint one
half ABCD <i>red</i>, the other half CF, <i>violet</i> or
indigo; and tying black threads across it, set it
near the flame of a candle G, then take a lens
HI, and holding a sheet of white paper behind it,
move it backwards and forwards upon the edge of
a graduated ruler, till you see the black threads
most distinctly in the image, and you will find the
focus of the violet <small>FE</small>, much nearer than that
of the red <small>AC</small>, which plainly shows that bodies of
different colours can never be depicted by convex-lenses,
without some degree of confusion.</p>

<p>The quantity of dispersion of the coloured rays
in convex lenses depends upon the focal length
of the glass; the space which the coloured images
occupy being about the twenty-eighth part. Thus
if the lens be twenty-eight inches focal distance,
the space between <span class="smcap">Rr</span> and <span class="smcap">Vv</span> (fig 32) will be
about one inch; if it be twenty-eight feet focus,
the same space will be about one foot, and so on
in proportion. Now, when such a succession of
images formed by the different coloured rays, is
viewed through an eye-glass, it will seem to form
but one image, and consequently very indistinct,
and tinged with various colours, and as the red
figure <span class="smcap">Rr</span> is largest, or seen under the greatest
angle&mdash;the extreme parts of this confused image
will be red, and a succession of the prismatic
colours will be formed within this red fringe, as is
generally found in common refracting-telescopes,
constructed with a single object-glass. It is owing
to this circumstance that the common refracting
telescope cannot be much improved without having
recourse to lenses of a very long focal distance;
and hence, about 150 years ago, such telescopes
were constructed of 80, and 100, and 120 feet in
length. But still the image was not formed so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
distinctly as was desired, and the aperture of the
object-glass was obliged to be limited. This is a
defect which was long regarded as without a
remedy; and even Newton himself despaired of
discovering any means by which the defects of
refracting telescopes might be removed and their
improvement effected. This, however, was accomplished
by Dollond to an extent far surpassing
what could have been expected, of which a particular
account will be given in the sequel.</p>

<p>It was originally remarked by Newton, and the
fact has since been confirmed by the experiments
of Sir W. Herschel, that <i>the different-coloured rays
have not the same illuminating power</i>. The violet
rays appear to have the least illuminating effect;
the indigo more, and the effect increases in the
order of the colours,&mdash;the <i>green</i> being very
great; between the green and the yellow the
greatest of all; the yellow the same as the green;
but the red less than the yellow. Herschel also
endeavoured to determine whether the power of
the differently-coloured rays to <i>heat</i> bodies, varied
with their power to illuminate them. He introduced
a beam of light into a dark room, which
was decomposed by a prism, and then exposed a
very sensible thermometer to all the rays in succession,
and observed the heights to which it rose
in a given time. He found that their heating
power increased from the violet to the red. The
mercury in the thermometer rose higher when its
bulb was placed in the Indigo than when it was
placed in the violet, still higher in blue, and highest
of all at red. Upon placing the bulb of the
thermometer below the red, quite out of the
spectrum, he was surprised to find that the mercury
rose highest of all; and concluded that <i>rays proceed
from the sun, which have the power of</i> <small>HEATING</small>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
<i>but not of illuminating bodies</i>. These rays
have been called <i>invisible</i> solar rays. They were
about half an inch from the commencement of the
red rays; at a greater distance from this point the
heat began to diminish, but was very perceptible
even at the distance of 1&frac12; inch. He determined
that the heating power of the <i>red</i> to that of the
<i>green</i> rays, was 2&frac34; to 1, and 3&frac12; to 1, in red
to <i>violet</i>. He afterwards made experiments to
collect those invisible calorific rays, and caused
them to act independently of the light, from
which he concluded that they are sufficient to
account for all the effects produced by the solar
rays in exciting heat; that they are capable of
passing through glass, and of being refracted and
reflected, after they have been finally detached
from the solar beam.</p>

<p>M. Ritter of Jena, Wollaston, Beckman and
others, have found that the rays of the spectrum
are possessed of certain <i>chemical properties</i>&mdash;that
beyond the least brilliant extremity, namely, a
little beyond the <i>violet</i> ray, there are <i>invisible</i> rays
which act chemically, while they have neither the
power of heating nor illuminating bodies. Muriate
of silver exposed to the action of the red rays
becomes blackish; a greater effect is produced by
the yellow: a still greater by the violet, and the
greatest of all by the <i>invisible</i> rays <i>beyond</i> the
violet. When phosphorus is exposed to the action
of the invisible rays beyond the red, it emits white
fumes; but the invisible rays beyond the violet
extinguish them. The influence of these rays
is daily seen in the change produced upon vegetable
colours, which fade, when frequently exposed
to the direct influence of the sum. What object
they are destined to accomplish in the general
economy of nature, is not yet distinctly known;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
we cannot however doubt that they are essentially
requisite to various processes going forward in the
material system. And we know that, not only
the comfort of all the tribes of the living world,
but the very existence of the animal and vegetable
creation depends upon the unremitting agency of
the <i>Calorific</i> rays.</p>

<p>It has likewise been lately discovered that
certain rays of the spectrum, particularly the
<i>violet, possesses the property of communicating the
magnetic power</i>. Dr. <i>Morichini</i>, of Rome, appears
to have been the first who found that the violet
rays of the spectrum had this property. The
result of his experiments, however, was involved
in doubt, till it was established by a series of experiments
instituted by Mrs. <i>Somerville</i>, whose
name is so well known in the scientific world.
This lady having covered half of a sewing-needle,
about an inch long, with paper, she exposed the
other half for two hours, to the violet rays. The
needle had then acquired North polarity. The
indigo rays produced nearly the same effect; and
the blue and green rays produced it in a still less
degree. In the yellow, orange, red and invisible
rays, no magnetic influence was exhibited, even
though the experiment was continued for three
successive days. The same effects were produced
by enclosing the needle in blue or green glass, or
wrapping it in blue and green ribbands one half
of the needle being always covered with paper.</p>

<p>One of the most curious discoveries of modern
times, in reference to the solar spectrum, is that
of Fraunhofer of Munich&mdash;one of the most distinguished
artists and opticians on the Continent.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
He discovered that the spectrum is covered with
dark and coloured lines, parallel to one another,
and perpendicular to the length of the spectrum;
and he counted no less than 590 of these lines. In
order to observe these lines, it is necessary to use
prisms of the most perfect construction, of very
pure glass, free of veins&mdash;to exclude all extraneous
light, and even to stop those rays which form
the coloured spaces, which we are not examining.
It is necessary also to use a magnifying instrument,
and the light must enter and emerge from
the prism at equal angles. One of the important
practical results of this discovery is, that those
lines are fixed points in the spectrum, or rather,
that they have always the same position in the
coloured spaces in which they are found. Fraunhofer
likewise discovered in the spectrum produced
by the light of Venus, the same streaks, as
in the solar spectrum; in the spectrum of the
light of Sirius, he perceived three large streaks
which, according to appearance, had no resemblance
to those of the light of the sun; one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
them was in the green, two in the blue. The
stars appear to differ from one another in their
streaks. The electric light differs very much
from the light of the sun and that of a lamp, in
regard to the streaks of the spectrum&mdash;‘This
experiment may also be made, though in an
imperfect manner, by viewing a narrow slit between
two nearly closed window-shutters, through
a very excellent glass prism held close to the eye,
with the refracting angle parallel to the line of
light. When the spectrum is formed by the sun’s
rays, either direct or indirect, as from the sky,
clouds, rainbow, moon, or planets, the black bands
are always found to be in the same parts of the
spectrum, and under all circumstances to maintain
the same relative position, breadth and intensities.’</p>

<p>From what has been stated in reference to the
solar spectrum it will evidently appear, that white
light is nothing else than a compound of all the
prismatic colours; and this may be still farther
illustrated by shewing, that the seven primary
colours, when again put together, recompose
white light. This may be rudely proved for the
purpose of illustration, by mixing together seven
different powders, having the colours and proportion
of the spectrum; but the best mode, on the
whole, is the following. Let two circles be drawn
on a smooth round board, covered with white
paper, as in fig. 34: Let the outermost be divided
into 360 equal parts; then draw seven right lines
as A,B,C, &amp;c., from the center to the outermost
circle, making the lines A and B include 80
degrees of that circle. The lines B and C, 40
degrees; C and D, 60; D and E, 60; E and F,
48; F and G, 27; G and A, 45. Then between
these two circles paint the space AG red, inclining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
to orange near G; GF orange, inclining to
yellow near F; FE yellow, inclining to green near
E; ED green, inclining to blue near D; DC blue,
inclining to indigo near C; CB indigo, inclining
to violet near B; and BA violet, inclining to a
soft red near A. This done, paint all that part
of the board black which lies within the inner
circle; and putting an axis through the centre of
the board, let it be turned swiftly round that axis,
so that the rays proceeding from the above colours,
may be all blended and mixed together in coming
to the eye. Then the whole coloured part will
appear like a white ring a little grayish&mdash;not perfectly
white, because no art can prepare or lay on
perfect colours, in all their delicate shades, as found
in the real spectrum.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 34.</i></p>
<img id="fig034" src="images/fig034.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That all the colours of light, when blended together
in their proper proportions, produce a pure
<i>white</i> is rendered certain by the following experiment.
Take a large convex glass, and place it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
in the room of the paper or screen on which the
solar spectrum was depicted (LM fig. 31), the
glass will unite all the rays which come from the
prism, if a paper is placed to receive them, and
you will see a circular spot of a pure lively white.
The rays will cross each other in the focus of the
glass, and, if the paper be removed a little further
from that point, you will see the prismatic colours
again displayed, but in an inverted order, owing
to the crossing of the rays.</p>

<h4 id="ON_THE_COLOURS_OF_NATURAL_OBJECTS">SECT. 2.&mdash;ON THE COLOURS OF NATURAL OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>From what has been stated above we may learn
the true cause of those diversified hues exhibited
by natural and artificial objects, and the variegated
colouring which appears on the face of nature.
It is owing to the surfaces of bodies being disposed
to reflect one colour rather than another.
When this disposition is such that the body reflects
every kind of ray, in the mixed state in
which it receives them, that body appears <i>white</i>
to us&mdash;which, properly speaking, is no colour, but
rather the assemblage of all colours. If the body
has a fitness to reflect one sort of rays more
abundantly than others, by absorbing all the
others, it will appear of the colour belonging to
that species of rays. Thus, the grass is <i>green</i>,
because it absorbs all the rays except the green.
It is these green rays only which the grass, the
trees, the shrubs, and all the other verdant parts
of the landscape reflect to our sight, and which
make them appear green. In the same manner
the different flowers reflect their respective
colours; the rose, the red rays; the violet, the
blue; the jonquil, the yellow; the marigold, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
orange, and every object, whether natural or artificial,
appears of that colour which its peculiar
texture is fitted to reflect. A great number of
bodies are fitted to reflect at once several kinds of
rays, and of consequence they appear under mixed
colours. It may even happen, that of two bodies
which should be green, for example, one may
reflect the pure green of light, and the other the
mixture of yellow and blue. This quality, which
varies to infinity, occasions the different kinds of
rays to unite in every possible manner, and every
possible proportion; and hence the inexhaustible
variety of shades and hues which nature has
diffused over the landscape of the world. When
a body absorbs nearly all the light which reaches
it, that body appears <i>black</i>. It transmits to the
eye so few reflected rays that it is scarcely perceptible
in itself, and its presence and form make
no impression upon us, unless as it interrupts the
brightness of the surrounding space. Black is,
therefore, the absence of all the coloured rays.</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that all the various assemblages
of colours which we see in the objects
around us, <i>are not in the bodies themselves</i>, but
in the light which falls upon them. There is no
colour <i>inherent</i> in the grass, the trees, the fruits,
and the flowers, nor even in the most splendid and
variegated dress that adorns a lady. All such
objects are as destitute of colour, in themselves,
as bodies which are placed in the centre of the
earth, or as the chaotic materials out of which our
globe was formed, before light was created. For
where there is no light, there is no colour. Every
object is black, or without colour, in the dark,
and it only appears coloured as soon as light
renders it visible. This is further evident from
the following experiment. If we place a coloured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
body in one of the colours of the spectrum which
is formed by the prism, it appears of the colour
of the rays in which it is placed. Take, for example,
a red rose, and expose it first to the red
rays, and it will appear of a more brilliant ruddy
hue. Hold it in the blue rays, and it appears no
longer red, but of a dingy blue colour, and
in like manner its colour will appear different,
when placed in all the other differently
coloured rays. This is the reason why the colours
of objects are essentially altered by the nature of
the light in which they are seen. The colours
of ribbons and various pieces of silk or woollen
stuff are not the same when viewed by candle-light
as in the day time. In the light of a candle or a
lamp, blue often appears green, and yellow objects
assume a whitish aspect. The reason is that the
light of a candle is not so pure a white as that
of the sun, but has a yellowish tinge, and therefore,
when refracted by the prism, the yellowish
rays are found to predominate, and the superabundance
of yellow rays gives to blue objects a greenish
hue.</p>

<p>The doctrine we are now illustrating is one
which a great many persons, especially among the
fair sex, find it difficult to admit. They cannot
conceive it possible that there is no colour really
inherent in their splendid attire, and no tints of
beauty in their countenances. ‘What,’ said a
certain lady, ‘are there no colours in my shawl,
and in the ribbons that adorn my head-dress&mdash;and,
are we all as black as negroes in the dark; I
should almost shudder to think of it.’ Such
persons, however, need be in no alarm at the idea;
but may console themselves with the reflection,
that, when they are stripped of all their coloured
ornaments in the dark, they are certain that <i>they</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
<i>will never be seen by any one</i> in that state; and
therefore, there is no reason to regret the temporary
loss of those beauties which light creates&mdash;when
they themselves and all surrounding objects
are <i>invisible</i>. But, to give a still more palpable
proof of this position, the following popular experiments
may be stated.</p>

<p>Take a pint of common spirit, and pour it into
a soup dish, and then set it on fire; as it begins
to blaze, throw a handful of salt into the burning
spirit, and keep stirring it with a spoon. Several
handfuls may thus be successively thrown in, and
then the spectators, standing around the flame,
will see each other frightfully changed, their
colours being altered into a ghastly blackness, in
consequence of the nature of the light which falls
upon them&mdash;which produces colours very different
from those of the solar light. The following experiment,
as described by Sir D. Brewster, illustrates
the same principle. ‘Having obtained the means
of illuminating any apartment with <i>yellow</i> light, let
the exhibition be made in a room with furniture of
various bright colours, and with oil or water coloured
paintings on the wall. The party which is to
witness the experiment should be dressed in a
diversity of the gayest colours; and the brightest
coloured flowers, and highly coloured drawings
should be placed on the tables. The room being
at first lighted with ordinary lights, the bright
and gay colours of every thing that it contains
will be finely displayed. If the white lights are
now suddenly extinguished, and the yellow lamps
lighted, the most appalling metamorphosis will
be exhibited. The astonished individuals will
no longer be able to recognise each other. All
the furniture of the room, and all the objects it
contains, will exhibit only <i>one</i> colour. The flowers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
will lose their hues; the paintings and drawings
will appear as if they were executed in China ink,
and the gayest dresses, the brightest scarlets, the
purest lilacs, the richest blues and the most vivid
greens, will all be converted into one monotonous
yellow. The complexions of the parties, too, will
suffer a corresponding change. One pallid deathlike
yellow,
will envelope the young and the old, and the
<i>sallow</i> face will alone escape from the metamorphosis.
Each individual derives merriment from
the cadaverous appearance of his neighbour, without
being sensible that he is one of the ghastly
assemblage.’</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;Like the unnatural hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which autumn paints upon the perished leaf,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>From such experiments as these we might conclude,
that were the solar rays of a very different
description from what they are now found to be,
the colours which embellish the face of nature,
and the whole scene of our sublunary creation
would assume a new aspect, and appear very different
from what we now behold around us in
every landscape. We find that the stars display
great diversity of colour; which is doubtless owing
to the different kinds of light which are emitted
from those bodies; and hence we may conclude,
that the colouring thrown upon the various
objects of the universe is different in every
different system, and that thus, along with other
arrangements, an infinite variety of colouring and
of scenery is distributed throughout the immensity
of creation.</p>

<p>The <i>atmosphere</i>, in consequence of its different
refractive and reflective powers, is the source of a
variety of colours which frequently embellish and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
diversify the aspect of our sky. The air <i>reflects</i>
the blue rays most plentifully, and must therefore
<i>transmit</i> the red, orange, and yellow, more
copiously than the other rays. When the sun
and other heavenly bodies are at a high elevation,
their light is transmitted without any perceptible
change, but when they are near the horizon, their
light must pass through a long and dense track
of air, and must therefore be considerably modified
before it reach the eye of the observer. The momentum
of the red rays being greater than that
of the violet, will force their way through the
resisting medium, while the violet rays will be
either reflected or absorbed. If the light of the
setting sun, by thus passing through a long track
of air, be divested of the green, blue, indigo, and
violet rays, the remaining rays which are transmitted
through the atmosphere, will illuminate the
western clouds, first with an orange colour; and
then, as the sun gradually sinks into the horizon,
the track through which the rays must pass becoming
longer, the yellow and orange are reflected,
and the clouds grow more deeply <i>red</i>, till at length
the disappearance of the sun leaves them of a
leaden hue by the reflection of the blue light
through the air. Similar changes of colour are
sometimes seen on the eastern and western fronts
of white buildings. St. Paul’s Church, in London,
is frequently seen at sun-set, tinged with a very
considerable degree of redness; and the same
cause occasions the moon to assume a ruddy colour,
by the light transmitted through the atmosphere.
From such atmospherical refractions and reflections
are produced those rich and beautiful hues
with which our sky is gilded by the setting sun,
and the glowing red which tinges the morning
and evening clouds, till their ruddy glare is tempered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
by the purple of twilight, and the reflected
azure of the sky.</p>

<p>When a direct spectrum is thrown on colours
darker than itself, it mixes with them: as the
yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on the
green grass, becomes a greener yellow. But when
a direct spectrum is thrown on colours brighter
than itself, it becomes instantly changed into the
reverse spectrum, which mixes with those
brighter colours. Thus the yellow spectrum of
the setting sun thrown on the luminous sky, becomes
blue, and changes with the colour or brightness
of the clouds on which it appears. The
red part of light being capable of struggling
through thick and resisting mediums which intercept
all other colours&mdash;is likewise the cause why
the sun appears red when seen through a fog,&mdash;why
distant light, though transmitted through blue
or green glass, appears red&mdash;why lamps at a distance,
seen through the smoke of a long street,
are red, while those that are near, are white.
To the same cause it is owing that a diver at the
bottom of the sea is surrounded with the red
light which has pierced through the superincumbent
fluid, and that the blue rays are reflected
from the <i>surface</i> of the ocean. Hence, Dr. Halley
informs us that, when he was in a diving bell, at
the bottom of the sea, his hand always appeared
red in the water.</p>

<p>The <i>blue</i> rays, as already noticed, being unable
to resist the obstructions they meet with in their
course through the atmosphere, are either reflected
or absorbed in their passage. It is to this cause,
that most philosophers ascribe <i>the blue colour of
the sky</i>, the faintness and obscurity of distant
objects, and the bright azure which tinges the
mountains of a distant landscape.

<h4 id="PHENOMENA_OF_THE_RAINBOW">SECT. 3.&mdash;PHENOMENA OF THE RAINBOW.</h4>

<p>Since the rays of light are found to be decomposed
by refracting surfaces, and reflected in an
infinite variety of modes and shades of colour, we
need not be surprised at the changes produced in
any scene or object by the intervention of another,
and by the numerous modifications of which the
primary colours of nature are susceptible. The
vivid colours which gild the rising and the setting
sun, must necessarily differ from those which adorn
its noon-day splendour. Variety of atmospheric
scenery will thus necessarily be produced, greater
than the most lively fancy can well imagine. The
clouds will sometimes assume the most fantastic
forms, and at other times will be irradiated with
beams of light, or, covered with the darkest
hues, will assume a lowering aspect, prognostive
of the thunder’s roar and the lightning’s
flash&mdash;all in accordance with the different rays
that are reflected to our eyes, or the quantity
absorbed by the vapours which float in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Light, which embellishes with so much magnificence
a pure and serene sky, by means of innumerable
bright starry orbs which are spread over
it, sometimes, in a dark and cloudy sky, exhibits
an ornament which, by its pomp, splendour and
variety of colours, attracts the attention of every
eye that has an opportunity of beholding it. At
certain times, when there is a shower either
around us, or at a distance from us in an opposite
quarter to that of the sun, a species of arch
or bow is seen in the sky, adorned with all the
seven primary colours of light. This phenomenon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
which is one of the most beautiful meteors in
nature, has obtained the name of the <span class="smcap">Rainbow</span>.
The rainbow was, for ages, considered as an
inexplicable mystery, and by some nations it was
adored as a deity. Even after the dawn of true
philosophy, it was a considerable time before any
discovery of importance was made, as to the true
causes which operate in the production of this
phenomenon. About the year 1571, M. Fletcher
of Breslau, made a certain approximation to the
discovery of the true cause, by endeavouring to
account for the colours of the rainbow by means
of a double refraction and one reflection. A
nearer approximation was made by Antonio de
Dominis, bishop of Spalatro, about 1601. He
maintained that the double refraction of Fletcher,
<i>with an intervening reflection</i>, was sufficient to
produce the colours of the bow, and also to bring
the rays that formed them to the eye of the spectator,
without any subsequent reflection. To
verify this hypothesis, he procured a small globe
of solid glass, and viewing it when it was exposed
to the rays of the sun&mdash;with his back to that
luminary&mdash;in the same manner as he had supposed
the drops of rain were situated with respect to
them, he observed the same colours which he had
seen in the rainbow, and in the same order.
But he could give no good reason <i>why</i> the bow
should be coloured, and much less any satisfactory
account of the <i>order</i> in which the colours appear.
It was not till Sir I. Newton discovered the different
refrangibility of the rays of light, that a
complete and satisfactory explanation could be
given of all the circumstances connected with this
phenomenon.</p>

<p>As the full elucidation of this subject involves
a variety of optical and mathematical investigations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
I shall do little more than explain the
general principle on which the prominent phenomena
of the rainbow may be accounted for, and
some of the facts and results which theory and
observation have deduced.</p>

<p>We have just now alluded to an experiment
with a glass globe:&mdash;If, then, we take either a
solid glass globe, or a hollow globe filled with
water, and suspend it so high in the solar rays
above the eye, that the spectator, with his back
to the sun, can see the globe <i>red</i>;&mdash;if it be
lowered slowly, he will see it orange, then yellow,
then green, then blue, then indigo, and then
violet; so that the drop at different heights, shall
present to the eye the seven primitive colours in
succession. In this case, the globe, from its
form, will act in some measure like a prism, and
the ray will be separated into its component parts.
The following figure will more particularly illustrate
this point. Suppose A (fig. 35.) to represent
a drop of rain&mdash;which may be considered as
a globe of glass in miniature, and will produce
the same effect on the rays of light&mdash;and let <span class="smcap">Sd</span>
represent a ray from the sun falling upon the
upper part of the drop at <small>D</small>. At the point of
entering the drop, it will suffer a refraction, and
instead of going forward to <small>C</small>, it will be bent to <small>N</small>.
From <small>N</small> a part of the light will be reflected to <small>Q</small>&mdash;some
part of it will, of course, pass through the
drop. By the obliquity with which it falls on the
side of the drop at <small>Q</small>, that part becomes a kind of
prism, and separates the ray into its primitive
colours. It is found by computation that, after a
ray has suffered two refractions and one reflection,
as here represented, the least refrangible part of
it, namely the <i>red</i> ray, will make an angle with
the incident solar ray of 42&deg; 2&acute;, as <span class="smcap">Sfq</span>; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
violet, or greatest refrangible ray will make with
the solar ray, an angle of 40&deg; 17&acute;, as <span class="smcap">Scq</span>; and
thus all the particles of water within the difference
of those two angles, namely 1&deg; 45&acute;&mdash;(supposing
the ray to proceed merely from the centre of the
sun)&mdash;will exhibit severally the colours of the prism,
and constitute the <i>interior</i> bow of the cloud.
This holds good at whatever height the sun may
chance to be in a shower of rain. If he be at a
high altitude, the rainbow will be low; if he be
at a low elevation, the rainbow must be high;
and if a shower happen in a vale, when the spectator
is on a mountain, he will sometimes see the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
bow in the form of a <i>complete circle</i> below him.
We have at present described the phenomena
only of a single drop; but it is to be considered
that in a shower of rain there are drops at all
heights and at all distances; and therefore the eye
situated at G will see all the different colours. All
those drops that are in a certain position with
respect to the spectator will reflect the red rays,
all those in the next station the orange, those in
the next the green, and so on with regard to all
the other colours.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 35.</i></p>
<img id="fig035" src="images/fig035.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It appears, then, that the first or primary bow
is formed by two refractions and one reflection;
but there is frequently a second bow, on the outside
of the other, which is considerably fainter.
This is produced by drops of rain above the drop
we have supposed at A. If B (fig. 35.) represent
one of these drops, the ray to be sent to the eye
enters the drop near the bottom, and suffers <i>two
refractions</i> and <i>two reflections</i>, by which means
the colours become reversed, that is, the violet is
lowest in the <i>exterior</i> bow, and the red is lowest
in the <i>interior</i> one, and the other colours are
reversed accordingly. The ray T is refracted at
<small>R</small>: a part of it is reflected from <small>S</small> to <small>T</small>, and at <small>T</small>
it suffers another reflection from <small>T</small> to <small>U</small>. At the
points <small>S</small> and <small>T</small> part of the ray <i>passes through</i> the
drop on account of its transparency, towards <small>W</small>
and <small>X</small>, and therefore we say that <i>part</i> only of the
ray is reflected. By these losses and reflections the
exterior bow becomes faint and ill-defined in
comparison of the interior or primary bow. In
this case the upper part of the secondary bow will
not be seen when the sun is above 54&deg; 10&acute; above
the horizon; and the lower part of the bow will
not be seen when the sun is 60&deg; 58&acute; above the
horizon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 36.</i></p>
<img id="fig036" src="images/fig036.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the further illustrations of this subject, we
may introduce the following section of a bow, (fig.
36.) and, in order to prevent confusion in attempting
to represent all the different colours&mdash;let us
suppose only three drops of rain, and three different
colours, as shown in the figure. The spectator
O being in the centre of the two bows, here
represented,&mdash;the planes of which must be considered
as perpendicular to his view&mdash;the drops
A,B, and C produce part of the interior bow by
two refractions and one reflection as stated above,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
and the drops D,E,F will produce the exterior bow
by two refractions and two reflections, the sun’s
rays being represented by 3,3. It is evident that
the angle COP is less than the angle BOP, and
that the angle AOP is the greatest of the three.
The largest angle, then, is formed by the red
rays, the middle one consists of the green, and
the smallest the purple or violet. All the drops
of rain, therefore, that happen to be in a certain
position with respect to the spectator’s eye, will
reflect the red rays, and form a band or semicircle
of red, and so of the other colours from drops in
other positions. If the spectator alters his station,
he will see a bow, but not the same as before;
and if there be many spectators, they will each see
a different bow, though it appears to be the same.</p>

<p>The rainbow assumes a <i>semicircular</i> appearance,
because it is only at certain angles that the
refracted rays are visible to our eyes, as is evident
from the experiment of the glass globe formerly
alluded to, which will refract the rays only in a
certain position. We have already stated that the
red rays make an angle of 42&deg; 2&acute;, and the violet
an angle of 40&deg; 17&acute;. Now, if a line be drawn
horizontally from the spectator’s eye, it is evident
that angles formed with this line, of a certain
dimension, in every direction, will produce a
circle, as will appear by attaching a cord of a
given length to a certain point, round which it
may turn as round its axis; and, in every point
will describe an angle with the horizontal line of
a certain and determinate extent.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that <i>three</i> or more bows
are visible, though with different degrees of distinctness.
I have more than once observed this
phenomenon, particularly in Edinburgh, in the
month of August, 1825, when three rainbows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
were distinctly seen in the same quarter of the sky;
and, if I recollect right, a fragment of a fourth
made its appearance. This happens when the
rays suffer a third or fourth reflection; but, on
account of the light lost by so many reflections,
such bows are, for the most part, altogether
imperceptible.</p>

<p>If there were no ground to intercept the rain
and the view of the observer, the rainbow would
form a <i>complete circle</i>, the centre of which is
diametrically opposite to the sun. Such circles are
sometimes seen in the spray of the sea or of a
cascade, or from the tops of lofty mountains, when
the showers happen in the vales below. Rainbows
of various descriptions are frequently observed
rising amidst the spray and exhalations of
waterfalls, and among the waves of the sea whose
tops are blown by the wind into small drops.
There is one regularly seen, when the sun is
shining, and the spectator in a proper position, at
the fall of Staubbach, in the bosom of the Alps;
one near Schaffhausen; one at the cascade of
Lauffen; and one at the cataract of Niagara in
North America. A still more beautiful one is
said to be seen at Terni, where the whole current
of the river Velino, rushing from a steep precipice
of nearly 200 feet high, presents to the
spectator below, a variegated circle, over-arching
the fall, and two other bows suddenly reflected
on the right and left. Don Ulloa, in the account of
his journeys in South America, relates that circular
rainbows are frequently seen on the mountains
above Quito in Peru. It is said that a rainbow
was once seen near London, caused by the exhalations
of that city, after the sun had been below
the horizon more than twenty minutes.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> A naval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
friend, says Mr. Bucke, informed me, that, as he
was one day watching the sun’s effect upon the
exhalations near Juan Fernandez, he saw upwards
of five-and-twenty <i>ires marin&aelig;</i> animate the sea at
the same time. In these marine bows the concave
sides were turned upwards, the drops of
water rising from below, and not falling from
above, as in the instances of the aerial arches.
Rainbows are also occasionally seen on the grass,
in the morning dew, and likewise when the hoar-frost
is descending. Dr. Langwith once saw a
bow lying on the ground, the colours of which
were almost as lively as those of a common rainbow.
It was not round but oblong, and was
extended several hundred yards. The colours
took up less space, and were much more lively in
those parts of the bow which were near him than
in those which were at a distance. When M.
Labillardiere was on Mount Teneriffe, he saw the
contours of his body traced on the clouds beneath
him in all the colours of the solar bow. He had
previously witnessed this phenomenon on the
Kesrouan in Asia Minor. The rainbows of
Greenland are said to be frequently of a pale
white, fringed with a brownish yellow, arising
from the rays of the sun being reflected from a
frozen cloud.</p>

<p>The following is a summary view of the principal
facts which have been ascertained respecting
the rainbow:&mdash;1. The rainbow can only be seen
when it rains, and in that point of the heavens
which is opposite to the sun. 2. Both the primary
and secondary bows are variegated with all the
prismatic colours&mdash;the red being the highest
colour in the primary, or brightest bow, and the
violet the highest in the exterior. 3. The primary
rainbow can never be a greater arc than a semicircle;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
and when the sun is set, no bow, in
ordinary circumstances, can be seen. 4. The
breadth of the inner or primary bow&mdash;supposing
the sun but a point&mdash;is 1&deg; 45&acute;; and the breadth
of the exterior bow 3&deg; 12&acute;, which is nearly twice
as great as that of the other; and the distance
between the bows is 8&deg; 55&acute;. But since the body
of the sun subtends an angle of about half a degree,
by so much will each bow be increased, and their
distance diminished; and therefore the breadth
of the interior bow will be 2&deg; 15&acute;, and that of the
exterior, 3&deg; 42&acute;, and their distance 8&deg; 25&acute;. The
greatest semidiameter of the interior bow, on the
same grounds, will be 42&deg; 17&acute;, and the least of
the exterior bow 50&deg; 43&acute;. 5. When the sun is in
the horizon, either in the morning or evening, the
bows will appear complete semicircles. On the
other hand, when the sun’s altitude is equal to
42&deg; 2&acute; or to 54&deg; 10&acute;, the summits of the bows will
be depressed below the horizon. Hence, during
the days of summer, within a certain interval
each day, no visible rainbows can be formed, on
account of the sun’s high altitude above the
horizon. 6. The altitude of the bows above the
horizon, or surface of the earth, varies, according
to the elevation of the sun. The altitude, at any
time, may be taken by a common quadrant, or
other angular instrument; but, if the sun’s altitude
at any particular time be known, the height
of the summit of any of the bows may be found,
by subtracting the sun’s altitude from 42&deg; 2&acute; for
the inner bow, and from 54&deg; 10&acute;, for the outer.
Thus, if the sun’s altitude were 26&deg;, the height
of the primary bow would 16&deg; 2&acute;, and of the
secondary, 28&deg; 10&acute;. It follows, that the height and
the size of the bows diminish as the altitude of the
sun increases. 7. If the sun’s altitude is more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
than 42 degrees, and less than 54&deg;, the exterior
bow may be seen though the interior bow is invisible.
8. Sometimes only a portion of an arch will
be visible while all the other parts of the bow are
invisible. This happens when the rain does not
occupy a space of sufficient extent to complete
the bow; and the appearance of this position, and
even of the bow itself, will be various, according
to the nature of the situation, and the space
occupied by the rain.</p>

<p>The appearance of the rainbow may be produced
by artificial means, at any time when the
sun is shining and not too highly elevated above
the horizon. This is effected by means of artificial
fountains or <i>Jet d’eaus</i>, which are intended to
throw up streams of water to a great height.
These streams, when they spread very wide, and
blend together in their upper parts, form, when
falling, a shower of artificial rain. If, then, when
the fountain is playing, we move between it and
the sun, at a proper distance from the fountain, till
our shadow point directly towards it, and look at
the shower,&mdash;we shall observe the colours of the
rainbow, strong and vivid; and, what is particularly
worthy of notice, the bow appears, notwithstanding
the nearness of the shower, to be as
large, and as far off, as the rainbow which we see
in a natural shower of rain. The same experiment
may be made by candle-light, and with any
instrument that will form an artificial shower.</p>

<p><i>Lunar Rainbows.</i>&mdash;A lunar bow is sometimes
formed at night by the rays of the moon striking
on a rain-cloud, especially when she is about the
full. But such a phenomenon is very rare. Aristotle
is said to have considered himself the first
who had seen a lunar rainbow. For more than a
hundred years prior to the middle of the last century,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
we find only two or three instances recorded
in which such phenomena are described with accuracy.
In the philosophical transactions for 1783,
however, we have an account of three having been
seen in one year, and all in the same place, but
they are by no means common phenomena. I
have had an opportunity within the last twenty
years of witnessing two phenomena of this description&mdash;one
of which was seen at Perth, on a
sabbath evening, in the autumn of 1825, and the
other at Edinburgh, on Wednesday, the 9th of
September 1840, about eight o’clock in the evening&mdash;of
both which I gave a detailed description
in some of the public journals. The Moon, in
both cases, was within a day or two of the full;
the arches were seen in the northern quarter of
the heavens, and extended nearly from east to
west, the moon being not far from the southern
meridian. The bows appeared distinct and well
defined, but no distinct traces of the prismatic
colours could be perceived on any of them. That
which appeared in 1825 was the most distinctly
formed, and continued visible for more than an
hour. The other was much fainter, and lasted
little more than half an hour, dark clouds having
obscured the face of the moon. These bows bore
a certain resemblance to some of the luminous
arches which sometimes accompany the Aurora
Borealis, and this latter phenomenon has not unfrequently
been mistaken for a Lunar rainbow;
but they may be always distinguished by attending
to the phases and position of the moon. If
the moon be not visible above the horizon, if she
be in her first or last quarter, or if any observed
phenomenon be not in a direction opposite to the
moon, we may conclude with certainty that, whatever
appearance is presented, there is no lunar
rainbow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>The rainbow is an object which has engaged
universal attention, and its beautiful colours and
form have excited universal admiration. The
poets have embellished their writings with many
beautiful allusions to this splendid meteor; and
the playful school-boy, while viewing the ‘bright
enchantment,’ has frequently run ‘to catch the
falling glory.’ When its arch rests on the opposite
sides of a narrow valley, or on the summits of
two adjacent mountains, its appearance is both
beautiful and grand. In all probability, its figure
first suggested the idea of <i>arches</i>, which are now
found of so much utility in forming aqueducts and
bridges, and for adorning the architecture of
palaces and temples. It is scarcely possible seriously
to contemplate this splendid phenomenon,
without feeling admiration and gratitude towards
that wise and beneficent Being, whose hands have
bent it into so graceful and majestic a form, and
decked it with all the pride of colours. “Look
upon the rainbow,” says the son of Sirach,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and
praise Him that made it: very beautiful it is in
the brightness thereof. It compasseth the heaven
about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the
Most High have bended it." To this grand etherial
bow, the inspired writers frequently allude
as one of the emblems of the majesty and splendour
of the Almighty. In the prophecies of
Ezekiel, the throne of Deity is represented as
adorned with a brightness “like the appearance
of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain&mdash;the
appearance of the likeness of the glory of
Jehovah.” And, in the visions recorded in the
Book of the Revelations, where the Most High is
represented as sitting upon a throne; “there was
a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
unto an emerald,” as an emblem of his propitious
character and of his faithfulness and mercy. After
the deluge, this bow was appointed as a sign and
memorial of the covenant which God made with
Noah and his sons, that a flood of waters should
never again be permitted to deluge the earth and
its inhabitants;&mdash;and as a pledge of inviolable fidelity
and Divine benignity. When, therefore, we
at any time behold “the bow in the cloud,” we
have not only a beautiful and sublime phenomenon
presented to the eye of sense, but also a memorial
exhibited to the mental eye, assuring us, that,
“While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest,
and cold and heat, and summer and winter,
and day and night, <i>shall not cease</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<h4 id="REFLECTIONS_ON_THE_BEAUTY_AND_UTILITY_OF_COLOURS">SECT. 4.&mdash;REFLECTIONS ON THE BEAUTY AND UTILITY OF COLOURS.</h4>

<p>Colour is one of the properties of light which
constitutes, chiefly, the beauty and sublimity of
the universe. It is colour, in all its diversified
shades, which presents to our view that almost infinite
variety of aspect which appears on the scene
of nature, which gives delight to the eye and the
imagination, and which adds a fresh pleasure to
every new landscape we behold. Every flower
which decks our fields and gardens is compounded
of different hues; every plain is covered with
shrubs and trees of different degrees of verdure;
and almost every mountain is clothed with herbs
and grass of different shade from those which
appear on the hills and landscape with which it is
surrounded. In the country, during summer,
nature is every day, and almost every hour, varying
her appearance, by the multitude and variety
of her hues and decorations, so that the eye wanders
with pleasure over objects continually diversified,
and extending as far as the sight can reach.
In the flowers with which every landscape is
adorned, what a lovely assemblage of colours, and
what a wonderful art in the disposition of their
shades! Here, a light pencil seems to have laid on
the delicate tints; there, they are blended according
to the nicest rules of art. Although green is the
general colour which prevails over the scene of
sublunary nature, yet it is diversified by a thousand
different shades, so that every species of tree,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
shrub and herb, is clothed with its own peculiar
verdure. The dark green of the forests is thus
easily distinguished from the lighter shades of cornfields
and the verdure of the lawns. The system
of animated nature likewise, displays a diversified
assemblage of beautiful colours. The plumage of
birds, the brilliant feathers of the peacock, the
ruby and emerald hues which adorn the little
humming-bird, and the various embellishments of
many species of the insect tribe, present to the
eye, in every region of the globe, a scene of diversified
beauty and embellishment. Nor is the
mineral kingdom destitute of such embellishments.
For some of the darkest and most unshapely
stones and pebbles, when polished by the hand of
art, display a mixture of the most delicate and
variegated colours. All which beauties and varieties
in the scene around us are entirely owing to
that property, in every ray of light, by which it
is capable of being separated into the primitive
colours.</p>

<p>To the same cause, likewise, are to be ascribed
those beautiful and diversified appearances, which
frequently adorn the face of the sky,&mdash;the yellow,
orange and ruby hues which embellish the firmament
at the rising of the sun, and when he is about
to descend below the western horizon; and those
aerial landscapes, so frequently beheld in tropical
climes, where rivers, castles and mountains, are
depicted rolling over each other along the circle
of the horizon. The clouds, especially in some
countries, reflect almost every colour in nature.
Sometimes they wear the modest blush of the
rose; sometimes they appear like stripes of deep
vermillion, and sometimes as large brilliant masses
tinged with various hues; now they are white as
ivory, and now as yellow as native gold. In some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
tropical countries, according to St. Pierre, the
clouds roll themselves up into enormous masses as
white as snow, and are piled upon each other, like
the Cordeliers of Peru, and are moulded into the
shape of mountains, of caverns and of rocks. When
the sun sets behind this magnificent a&euml;rial net-work,
a multitude of luminous rays are transmitted through
each particular interstice, which produce such
an effect, that the two sides of the lozenge illuminated
by them, have the appearance of being begirt
with a fillet of gold; and the other two which
are in the shade, seem tinged with a superb
ruddy orange. Four or five divergent streams
of light, emanating from the setting sun up
to the zenith, clothe with fringes of gold the undeterminate
summits of this celestial barrier, and
proceed to strike with the reflexes of their fires
the pyramids of the collateral aerial mountains,
which then appear to consist of silver and vermilion.&mdash;In
short, colour diversifies every sublunary
scene, whether on the earth or in the atmosphere,
it imparts a beauty to the phenomena of falling
stars, of luminous arches, and the coruscations of
the Aurora Borealis, and gives a splendour and
sublimity to the spacious vault of heaven.</p>

<p>Let us now consider for a moment, what would
be the aspect of nature, if, instead of the beautiful
variety of embellishments which now appear on
every landscape, and on the concave of the sky,&mdash;<i>one</i>
uniform colour had been thrown over the
scenery of the universe. Let us conceive the
whole of terrestrial nature to be covered with
snow, so that not an object on earth should appear
with any other hue, and that the vast expanse of
the firmament presented precisely the same uniform
aspect. What would be the consequence?
The light of the sun would be strongly reflected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
from all the objects within the bounds of our horizon,
and would produce a lustre which would
dazzle every eye. The day would acquire a greater
<i>brightness</i> than it now exhibits, and our eyes
might, after some time, be enabled freely to expatiate
over the surrounding landscape; but every
thing, though enlightened, would appear <i>confused</i>,
and particular objects would scarcely be distinguishable.
A tree, a house or a church, near at
hand, might possibly be distinguished, on account
of its elevation above the general surface of the
ground, and the bed of a river by reason of its
being depressed below it. But we should be
obliged rather to guess, and to form a conjecture
as to the particular object we wished to distinguish,
than to arrive at any certain conclusion respecting
it; and if it lay at a considerable distance, it would
be impossible, with any degree of probability,
to discriminate any one object from another. Notwithstanding
the universal brightness of the scene,
the uniformity of colour thrown on every object,
would most certainly prevent us from distinguishing
a church from a palace, a cottage from a knoll
or a heap of rubbish, a splendid mansion from
rugged rocks, the trees from the hills on which
they grow, or a barren desert from rich and fertile
plains. In such a case, human beings would
be confounded, and even friends and neighbours
be at a loss to recognize one another.</p>

<p>The vault of heaven, too, would wear a uniform
aspect. Neither planets nor comets would be visible
to any eye, nor those millions of stars which
now shine forth with so much brilliancy, and diversify
the nocturnal sky. For, it is by the contrast
produced by the deep azure of the heavens
and the white radiance of the stars, that those
bodies are rendered visible. Were they depicted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
on a pure white ground, they would not be distinguished
from that ground, and would consequently
be invisible, unless any of them occasionally assumed
a different colour. Of course, all that
beautiful variety of aspect which now appears on
the face of sublunary nature&mdash;the rich verdure of
the fields, the stately port of the forest, the rivers
meandering through the valleys, the splendid hues
that diversify and adorn our gardens and meadows,
the gay colouring of the morning and evening
clouds, and all that variety which distinguishes the
different seasons, would entirely disappear. As
every landscape would exhibit nearly the same
aspect, there would be no inducement to the poet
and the philosopher to visit distant countries to
investigate the scenes of nature, and journeyings
from one region to another would scarcely be productive
of enjoyment. Were any other single
colour to prevail, nearly the same results would
ensue. Were a deep ruddy hue to be uniformly
spread over the scene of creation, it would not
only be offensive to the eye, but would likewise
prevent all distinction of objects. Were a dark
blue or a deep violet to prevail, it would produce
a similar effect, and at the same time, present the
scene of nature as covered with a dismal gloom.
Even if creation were arrayed in a robe of <i>green</i>,
which is a more pleasant colour to the eye&mdash;were
it not diversified with the different shades it now
exhibits, every object would be equally undistinguishable.</p>

<p>Such would have been the aspect of creation,
and the inconveniences to which we should
have been subjected, had the Creator afforded us
light without that intermixture of colours which
now appears over all nature, and which serves to
discriminate one object from another. Even our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
very apartments would have been tame and insipid,
incapable of the least degree of ornament, and
the articles with which they are furnished, almost
undistinguishable, so that in discriminating one
object from another, we should have been as much
indebted to the sense of touch as to the sense of
vision. Our friends and fellow men would have
presented no objects of interest in our daily associations.
The sparkling eye, the benignant smile,
the modest blush, the blended hues of white and
vermillion in the human face, and the beauty of
the female countenance, would all have vanished,
and we should have appeared to one another as so
many moving marble statues cast nearly in the
same mould. But, what would have been worst
of all, the numerous delays, uncertainties and perplexities
to which we should have been subjected,
had we been under the necessity, every moment,
of distinguishing objects by trains of reasoning,
and by circumstances of time, place, and relative
position? An artist, when commencing his work
in the morning, with a hundred tools of nearly the
same size and shape around him, would have spent
a considerable portion of his time before he could
have selected those proper for his purpose, or the
objects to which they were to be applied; and in
every department of society, and in all our excursions
from one place to another, similar difficulties
and perplexities would have occurred. The one
half of our time must thus have been employed
in uncertain guesses, and perplexing reasonings,
respecting the real nature and individuality of
objects, rather than in a regular train of thinking
and of employment; and after all our perplexities
and conjectures, we must have remained in the
utmost uncertainty, as to the thousands of scenes
and objects, which are now obvious to us, through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the instrumentality of colours, as soon as we open
our eyes.</p>

<p>In short, without colour, we could have had no
books nor writings: we could neither have corresponded
with our friends by letters, nor have known
any thing with certainty, of the events which
happened in former ages. No written revelation
of the will of God, and of his character, such as
we now enjoy, could have been handed down to
us from remote periods and generations. The
discoveries of science, and the improvements of
art, would have remained unrecorded. Universal
ignorance would have prevailed throughout the
world, and the human mind have remained in a
state of demoralization and debasement. All
these, and many other inconveniences and evils
would have inevitably followed, had not God
painted the rays of light with a diversity of colours,
And hence we may learn, that the most important
scenes and events in the universe, may depend
upon the existence of a single principle in nature,
and even upon the most minute circumstances,
which we may be apt to overlook, in the arrangements
of the material world.</p>

<p>In the existing state of things in the visible
creation, we cannot but admire the Wisdom and
Beneficence of the Deity, in thus enabling us to
distinguish objects by so easy and expeditious a
mode as <i>that of colour</i>, which in a moment, discriminates
every object and its several relations. We
rise in the morning to our respective employments,
and our food, our drink, our tools, our books, and
whatever is requisite for our comfort, are at once
discriminated. Without the least hesitation or
uncertainty, and without any perplexing process
of reasoning, we can lay our hands on whatever
articles we require. Colour clothes every object
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
with its peculiar livery, and infallibly directs the
hand in its movements, and the eye in its surveys
and contemplations. But, this is not the only end
which the Divine Being had in view, in impressing
on the rays of light a diversity of colours. It is
evident, that he likewise intended to minister to
our <i>pleasures</i>, as well as to our wants. To every
man of taste, and almost to every human being,
the combination of colours in flowers, the delicate
tints with which they are painted, the diversified
shades of green with which the hills and dales, the
mountains and the vales are arrayed; and that
beautiful variety which appears in a bright summer
day, on all the objects of this lower creation&mdash;are
sources of the purest enjoyment and delight.
It is colour, too, as well as magnitude, that adds to
the <i>sublimity</i> of objects. Were the canopy of
heaven of one uniform hue, it would fail in producing
those lofty conceptions, and those delightful
and transporting emotions, which a contemplation
of its august scenery is calculated to inspire.
Colours are likewise of considerable utility in the
intercourse of general society. They serve both
for ornaments, and for distinguishing the different
ranks and conditions of the community: they add
to the beauty and gracefulness of our furniture
and clothing. At a glance, they enable us at once
to distinguish the noble from the ignoble, the
prince from his subjects, the master from his servant,
and the widow clothed with sable weeds from
the bride adorned with her nuptial ornaments.</p>

<p>Since colours, then, are of so much value and
importance, they may be reckoned as holding a
rank among the noblest natural gifts of the Creator.
As they are of such essential service to the
inhabitants of our globe, there can be no doubt
that they serve similar or analogous purposes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
throughout all the worlds in the universe. The
colours displayed in the solar beams are common
to all the globes which compose the planetary
system, and must necessarily be reflected, in all
their diversified hues, from objects on their surfaces.
The light which radiates from the fixed
stars displays a similar diversity of colours. Some
of the double stars are found to emit light of
different hues;&mdash;the larger star exhibiting light of
a ruddy or orange hue, and the smaller one a
radiance which approaches to blue or green. There
is therefore reason to conclude, that the objects
connected with the planets which revolve round
such stars&mdash;being occasionally enlightened by suns
of different hues&mdash;will display a more variegated
and splendid scenery of colouring than is ever
beheld in the world on which we dwell; and that
one of the distinguishing characteristics of different
worlds, in regard to their embellishments,
may consist in the splendour and variety of colours
with which the objects on their surfaces are
adorned. In the metaphorical description of the
glories of the New Jerusalem, recorded in the
Book of Revelation, one of the chief characteristics
of that city is said to consist in the splendour
and diversity of hues with which it is adorned.
It is represented as “coming down from heaven,
<i>prepared as a bride adorned for her husband</i>,”
and as reflecting all the beautiful and variegated
colours which the finest gems on earth can exhibit;
evidently indicating, that splendour and variety
of colouring are some of the grandest features of
celestial scenery.</p>

<p>On the whole, the subject of colours, when
seriously considered, is calculated to excite us to
the adoration of the goodness and intelligence of
that Almighty Being whose wisdom planned all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the arrangements of the universe, and to inspire
us with gratitude for the numerous conveniences
and pleasures we derive from those properties and
laws he has impressed on the material system.
He might have afforded us light, and even splendid
illumination, without the pleasures and advantages
which diversified colours now produce, and man
and other animated beings might have existed in
such a state. But, what a very different scene
would the world have presented from what it now
exhibits! Of how many thousands of pleasures
should we have been deprived! and to what
numerous inconveniences and perplexities should
we have been subjected! The sublimity and
glories of the firmament, and the endless beauties
and varieties which now embellish our terrestrial
system, would have been for ever unknown, and
man could have had little or no incitement to study
and investigate the works of his Creator. In this,
as well as in many other arrangements in nature,
we have a sensible proof of the presence and
agency of that Almighty Intelligence “in whom
we live, and move, and have our being.” None
but an infinitely Wise and Beneficent Being, intimately
present in all places, could thus so regularly
create in us by means of colour, those exquisite
sensations which afford so much delight, and
which unite us, as it were, with every thing around
us. In the diversity of hues spread over the face
of creation, we have as real a display of the
Divine presence as Moses enjoyed at the burning
bush. The only difference is, that the one was
out of the common order of Divine procedure,
and the other in accordance with those permanent
laws which regulate the economy of the universe.
In every colour, then, which we contemplate, we
have a sensible memorial of the presence of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Being “whose Spirit garnished the heavens and
laid the foundations of the earth,” and whose
“merciful visitation” sustains us every moment
in existence. But the revelation of God to
our senses, through the various objects of the material
world, has become so familiar, that we are
apt to forget the Author of all our enjoyments,
even at the moment when we are investigating his
works and participating of his benefits. “O that
men would praise Jehovah for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works towards the children of
men.”

<h4 id="HISTORY_OF_THE_INVENTION_OF_TELESCOPES">HISTORY OF THE INVENTION OF TELESCOPES.</h4>

<p>The telescope is an optical instrument for
viewing objects at a distance. Its name is compounded
of two Greek words,&mdash;τηλε, which signifies,
<i>at a distance</i>, or <i>far off</i>, and σχοπειν, <i>to view</i>, or
to <i>contemplate</i>. By means of telescopes, remote
objects are represented as if they were near, small
apparent magnitudes are enlarged, confused
objects are rendered distinct, and the invisible
and obscure parts of very distant scenes are rendered
perceptible and clear to the organ of vision.
The telescope is justly considered as a grand
and noble instrument. It is not a little surprising
that it should be in the power of man to invent
and construct an instrument by which objects, too
remote for the unassisted eye to distinguish,
should be brought within the range of distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
vision, as if they were only a few yards from our
eye, and that thousands of august objects in the
heavens, which had been concealed from mortals
for numerous ages, should be brought within the
limits of our contemplation, and be as distinctly
perceived, as if we had been transported many
millions of miles from the space we occupy,
through the celestial regions. The celebrated
Huygens remarks, in reference to this instrument,
that, in his opinion, ‘the wit and industry of man
has not produced any thing so noble and so worthy
of his faculties as this sort of knowledge; (namely
of the telescope) insomuch that if any particular
person had been so diligent and sagacious as to
invent this instrument from the principles of
nature and geometry,&mdash;for my part, I should have
thought his abilities were more than human; but
the case is so far from this, that the most learned
men have not yet been able sufficiently to explain
the reason of the effects of this casual invention.’</p>

<p>The persons who constructed the first telescopes,
and the exact period when they were first invented,
are involved in some degree of obscurity. It
does not certainly appear that such instruments
were known to the ancients, although we ought
not to be perfectly decisive on this point. The
cabinets of the curious contain some very ancient
gems, of admirable workmanship, the figures on
which are so small, that they appear beautiful
through a magnifying glass, but altogether confused
and indistinct to the naked eye: and, therefore,
it may be asked, if they cannot be <i>viewed</i>,
how could they <i>be wrought</i>, without the assistance
of glasses? And as some of the ancients have
declared that the moon has a form like that of the
earth, and has plains, hills, and valleys in it,&mdash;how
could they know this&mdash;unless by mere conjecture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
without the use of a telescope? And how could
they have known that the <i>Milky Way</i> is formed
by the combined rays of an infinite number of
stars? For Ovid states, in reference to this zone,
‘its ground-work is of stars.’ But whatever
knowledge the ancients may have possessed of the
telescope or other optical glasses, it is quite evident
that they never had telescopes of such size
and power as those which we now possess; and
that no discoveries in the heavens, such as are now
brought to light, were made by any of the ancient
astronomers; otherwise some allusions to them
must have been found in their writings.</p>

<p>Among the moderns, the illustrious Friar Bacon
appears to have acquired some rude ideas respecting
the construction of telescopes. ‘Lenses and
specula’ says he, ‘may be so figured that one
object may be multiplied into many, that those
which are situated at a great distance may be
made to appear very near, that those which are
small may be made to appear very large, and those
which are obscure very plain; and we can make
stars to appear wherever we will.’ From these
expressions, it appears highly probable, that this
philosopher was acquainted with the general principle
both of telescopes and microscopes, and that
he may have constructed telescopes of small magnifying
power, for his own observation and amusement,
although they never came into general use.
He was a man of extensive learning, and made so
rapid a progress in the sciences, when attending
the university of Paris, that he was esteemed the
glory of that seat of learning. He prosecuted
his favourite study of experimental philosophy
with unremitting ardour; and in this pursuit, in
the course of twenty years, he expended no less
than &pound;2000 in experiments, instruments, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
procuring scarce books. In consequence of such
extraordinary talents, and such astonishing progress
in the sciences, in that ignorant age, he was
represented, by the envy of his illiterate fraternity,
as having dealings with the devil; and, under
this pretence, he was restrained from reading lectures,
and at length, in 1278, when sixty-four
years of age, he was imprisoned in his cell, where
he remained in confinement for ten years. He
shone like a single bright star in a dark hemisphere&mdash;the
glory of our country&mdash;and died at
Oxford, in the year 1294, in the eightieth year of
his age. ‘Friar Bacon,’ says the Rev. Mr. Jones,
‘may be considered as the first of English philosophers;
his profound skill in mechanics, optics,
astronomy, and chemistry, would make an honourable
figure in the present age. But he is entitled
to further praise, as he made all his studies subservient
to theology, and directed all his writings,
as much as could be, to the glory of God.
He had the highest regard for the sacred scriptures,
and was persuaded they contain the principles of
all true science.’</p>

<p>The next person who is supposed to have acquired
a knowledge of telescopes, was Joannes
Baptista Porta, of Naples, who flourished in the
sixteenth century. He discovered the <i>Camera
Obscura</i>&mdash;the knowledge of which might naturally
have led to the invention of the telescope; but it
does not appear that he ever constructed such an
instrument. Des Cartes considers James Metius,
a Dutchman, as the first constructor of a telescope,
and says, that ‘as he was amusing himself with
making mirrors and burning-glasses, he casually
thought of looking through two of his lenses at a
time, and found that distant objects appeared very
large and distinct.’ Others say that this great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
discovery was first made by John Lippersheim, a
maker of spectacles at Middleburg, or rather by
his children, who were diverting themselves with
looking through two glasses at a time, and placing
them at different distances from each other. But
Borellus, who wrote a book ‘on the invention of
the telescope,’ gives this honour to Zacharias
Jansen, another spectacle-maker in the same town,
who, he says, made the first telescope in 1590.
Jansen was a diligent inquirer into nature, and,
being engaged in such pursuits, he was trying
what use could be made of lenses for those purposes,
when he fortunately hit upon the construction.
Having found the arrangement of glasses
which produced the effect desired, he enclosed
them in a tube, and ran with his instrument to
prince Maurice, who, immediately conceiving that
it might be of use to him in his wars, desired the
author to keep it a secret. Such are the rude
conceptions and selfish views of princely <i>warriors</i>,
who would apply every invention in their power
for the destruction of mankind. But the telescope
was soon destined to more noble and honourable
achievements. Jansen, it is said, directed his instrument
towards celestial objects, and distinctly
saw the spots on the surface of the moon, and discovered
many new stars, particularly seven pretty
considerable ones in the Great Bear. His son
Joannes is said to have noted the lucid circle near
the lower limb of the moon, now named <i>Tycho</i>,
from whence several bright rays seem to dart in
different directions. In viewing Jupiter, he perceived
two, sometimes three, and at the most four
small stars, a little above or below him, and
thought that they performed revolutions around
him. This was, probably, the first observation of
the satellites of Jupiter, though the person who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
made it was not aware of the importance of his
discovery.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>It is not improbable that different persons
about Middleburgh hit upon the invention, in
different modes, about the same time. Lippersheim
seems to have made his first rude telescope by
adjusting two glasses on a board, and supporting
them on brass circles.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Other workmen, particularly
Metius and Jansen, in emulation of each
other, seem to have made use of that discovery,
and by the new form they gave it, made all the
honour of it their own. One of them, considering
the effects of light as injurious to distinctness,
placed the glasses in a tube blackened within.
The other, still more cautious, placed the same
glasses within tubes capable of sliding one in
another, both to vary the prospects, by lengthening
the instrument, according to the pleasure of
the observer, and to render it portable and commodious.
Thus, it is probable that different
persons had a share in the invention, and jointly
contributed to its improvement. At any rate, it
is undoubtedly to the Dutch that we owe the
original invention. The first telescope made by
Jansen, did not exceed fifteen or sixteen inches in
length, and therefore its magnifying power could
not have been very great.</p>

<p>The famous Galileo has frequently been supposed
to have been the inventor of the telescope,
but he acknowledges that he had not the honour
of being the original inventor, having first learned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
from a German, that such an instrument had
already been made; although, from his own account,
it appears that he had actually re-invented
this instrument. The following is the account, in
his own words, of the circumstances which led
him to construct a telescope. ‘Nearly ten months
ago (namely in April or May 1609) it was reported
that a certain Dutchman had made a perspective
through which many distant objects appeared distinct
as if they were near: several effects of this
wonderful instrument were reported, which some
believed and others denied: but, having it confirmed
to me a few days after by a letter from the
noble John Badoverie, at Paris, I applied myself
to consider the reason of it, and by what means I
might contrive a similar instrument, which I afterwards
attained to by the doctrine of refractions.
And, first, I prepared a leaden tube, to whose extremities
I fitted two spectacle-glasses, both of
them plain on one side, and on the other side, one
of them was spherically convex, and the other
concave. Then applying my eye to the concave,
I saw objects appear pretty large and pretty near
me. They appeared three times nearer and nine
times larger in surface than to the naked eye: and
soon after I made another, which represented objects
about sixty times larger, and eight times nearer;
and, at last, having spared no labour nor expense,
I made an instrument so excellent, as to show
things almost a thousand times larger, and above
thirty times nearer, than to the naked eye.’ In
another part of his writings, Galileo informs us
that ‘he was at Venice when he heard of Prince
Maurice’s instrument, but nothing of its construction;
that the first night, after he returned to
Padua, he solved the problem, and made his instrument
the next day; and soon after, presented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
it to the Doge at Venice, who, to do him honour
for his grand invention, gave him the ducal letters
which settled him for life in his lectureship at
Padua; and the Republic, on the twenty-fifth of
August in the same year (1610) more than tripled
his salary as professor.’</p>

<p>The following is the account which this philosopher
gives of the process of reasoning, which
led him to the construction of a telescope:&mdash;‘I
argued in the following manner. The contrivance
consists either of one glass or more&mdash;one is not
sufficient, since it must be either convex, concave,
or plane; the last does not produce any sensible
alteration in objects, the concave diminishes
them; it is true that the convex magnifies, but it
renders them confused and indistinct; consequently
one glass is insufficient to produce the desired
effect. Proceeding to consider two glasses, and
bearing in mind that the plane glass causes no
change, I determined that the instrument could
not consist of the combination of a plane glass
with either of the other two. I therefore applied
myself to make experiments on combinations of
the two other kinds; and thus obtained that of
which I was in search.’ If the true inventor is
the person who makes the discovery by reasoning
and reflection, by tracing facts and principles to
their consequences, and by applying his invention
to important purposes, then, Galileo may be considered
as the real inventor of the telescope. No
sooner had he constructed this instrument&mdash;before
he had seen any similar one&mdash;than he directed his
tube to the celestial regions, and his unwearied
diligence and ardour were soon rewarded by a series
of new and splendid discoveries. He descried
the four satellites of Jupiter, and marked the
periods of their revolutions; he discovered the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
phases of Venus, and thus was enabled to adduce
a new proof of the Copernican system, and to
remove an objection that had been brought against
it. He traced on the lunar orb, a resemblance to
the structure of the earth, and plainly perceived
the outlines of mountains and vales, casting their
shadows over different parts of its surface. He
observed, that when Mars was in quadrature, his
figure varied slightly from a perfect circle; and
that Saturn consisted of a triple body, having a
small globe on each side&mdash;which deception was
owing to the imperfect power of his telescope,
which was insufficient to show him that the phenomenon
was in reality a ring. In viewing the
sun, he discovered large dark spots on the surface
of that luminary, by which he ascertained that
that mighty orb performed a revolution round its
axis. He brought to view multitudes of stars
imperceptible to the naked eye, and ascertained
that those nebulous appearances in the heavens
which constitute the Milky Way, consist of a vast
collection of minute stars, too closely compacted
together to produce an impression on our unassisted
vision.</p>

<p>The results of Galileo’s observations were given
to the world in a small work, entitled ‘<i>Nuncius
Sidereus</i>,’ or, ‘News from the starry regions,’
which produced an extraordinary sensation among
the learned. These discoveries soon spread
throughout Europe, and were incessantly talked
of, and were the cause of much speculation and
debate among the circles of philosophers. Many
doubted; many positively refused to believe so
novel and unlooked-for announcements, because
they ran counter to the philosophy of Aristotle,
and all the preconceived notions which then prevailed
in the learned world. It is curious, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
may be instructive, to consider to what a length
of absurdity, ignorance and prejudice carried many
of those who made pretensions to learning and
science. Some tried to reason against the facts
alleged to be discovered, others contented themselves,
and endeavoured to satisfy others, with the
simple <i>assertion</i> that such things were not, and
could not possibly be; and the manner in which
they supported themselves in their incredulity
was truly ridiculous. ‘O my dear Kepler,’ says
Galileo in a letter to that astronomer, ‘how I wish
we could have one hearty laugh together. Here
at Padua is the principal professor of philosophy,
whom I have repeatedly and urgently requested
to look at the moon and planets through my glass,
which <i>he pertinaciously refuses to do</i>, lest his opinions
should be overturned. Why are you not
here? what shouts of laughter we should have at
this glorious folly! and to hear the professor of
philosophy at Pisa labouring with the Grand
Duke with logical arguments, as if with magical
incantations, to charm the new planets out of the
sky.’ Another opponent of Galileo, one Christmann,
says in a book he published, ‘We are not
to think that Jupiter has four satellites given him
by nature, in order, by revolving round him, to
immortalize the Medici who first had notice of
the observation. These are the <i>dreams of idle
men</i>, who love ludicrous ideas better than our
laborious and industrious correction of the heavens.
Nature abhors so horrible a chaos; and to
the truly wise, such vanity is detestable.’ One
Martin Horky, a would-be philosopher, declared
to Kepler, ‘I will never concede his four new
planets to that Italian from Padua, <i>though I should
die for it</i>;’ and he followed up this declaration, by
publishing a book against Galileo, in which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
examines four principal questions respecting the
alleged planets; 1. Whether they exist? 2.
What they are? 3. What they are like? 4.
Why they are? The first question is soon disposed
of by declaring positively that he has examined
the heavens with Galileo’s own glass, and
that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter
exists. To the second, he declares solemnly that
he does not more surely know, that he has a soul
in his body than that reflected rays are the sole
cause of Galileo’s erroneous observations. In
regard to the third question, he says, that these
planets are like the smallest fly compared to an
elephant; and finally, concludes on the fourth,
that the only use of them is to gratify Galileo’s
‘thirst of gold,’ and to afford himself a subject of
discussion. Kepler, in a letter to Galileo, when
alluding to Horky, says, ‘He begged so hard to be
forgiven, that I have taken him again into favour
upon this preliminary condition&mdash;that I am to
show him Jupiter’s satellites, <small>AND HE IS TO SEE
THEM</small>, and own that they are there.’</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of the reasoning
of certain pretended philosophers of that age
against the discoveries of Galileo. Sizzi, a Florentine
astronomer, reasons in this strain: ‘There
are seven windows given to animals in the domicile
of the head, through which the air is admitted
to the rest of the tabernacle of the body to enlighten,
to warm and to nourish it; two nostrils,
two eyes, two ears, and a mouth; so in the heavens,
or the great world, there are two favourable
stars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury
alone undecided and indifferent. From which
and many other similar phenomena in nature,
such as the seven metals, &amp;c., we gather that the
number of planets is <i>necessarily seven</i>. Moreover,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
the satellites are invisible to the naked eye,
and therefore can exert no influence on the earth,
and therefore would be useless, <i>and therefore do
not exist</i>. Besides, as well the Jews as other
ancient nations have adopted the division of the
week into seven days, and have named them from
the seven planets. Now, if we increase the number
of the planets, this whole system falls to the
ground.’ The opinions which then prevailed in
regard to Galileo’s observations on the moon, were
such as the following:&mdash;Some thought that the
dark shades on the moon’s surface arose from the
interposition of opaque bodies floating between
her and the sun, which prevent his light from
reaching those parts; others imagined that, on
account of her vicinity to the earth, she was partly
tainted with the imperfections of our terrestrial
and elementary nature, and was not of that
entirely pure and refined substance of which the
more remote heavens consist: and a third party
looked on her as a vast mirror, and maintained
that the dark parts of her surface were the reflected
images of our earthly forests and mountains.</p>

<p>Such learned nonsense is a disgrace to our
species, and to the rational faculties with which
man is endowed, and exhibits, in a most ludicrous
manner, the imbecility and prejudice of those
who made bold pretensions to erudition and philosophy.
The statement of such facts, however,
may be instructive, if they tend to guard us against
those prejudices and pre-conceived opinions, which
prevent the mind from the cordial reception of
truth, and from the admission of improvements in
society which run counter to long-established customs.
For the same principles and prejudices,
though in a different form, still operate in society
and retard the improvement of the social state,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
the march of science, and the progress of Christianity.
How ridiculous is it for a man, calling
himself a philosopher, to be afraid to look through
a glass to an existing object in the heavens, lest it
should endanger his previous opinions! And how
foolish is it to resist any improvement or reformation
in society, because it does not exactly
accord with existing opinions, and with ‘the
wisdom of our ancestors.’</p>

<p>It is not a little surprising, that Galileo should
have first hit on that construction of a telescope
which goes by his name, and which was formed
with a <i>concave</i> glass next the eye. This construction
of a telescope is more difficult to be understood,
in theory, than one which is composed
solely of convex glasses; and its field of view is comparatively
very small, so that it is almost useless
when attempted to be made of a great length.
In the present day, we cannot help wondering that
Galileo and other astronomers, should have made
such discoveries as they did with such an instrument,
the use of which must have required a great
degree of patience and address. Galileo’s best
telescope, which he constructed ‘with great
trouble and expense,’ magnified the diameters of
objects only thirty-three times; but its length is
not stated&mdash;which would depend upon the focal
distance of the concave eye-glass. If the eye-glass
was two inches focus, the length of the instrument
would be five feet four inches; if it was
only one inch, the length would be two feet eight
inches, which is the least we can allow to it&mdash;the
object-glass being thirty-three inches focus, and
the eye-glass placed an inch within this focus.
With this telescope, Galileo discovered the satellites
of Jupiter, the crescent of Venus, and the
other celestial objects to which we have already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
alluded. The telescopes made in Holland, are
supposed to have been constructed solely of <i>convex</i>
glasses, on the principle of the astronomical
telescope; and, if so, Galileo’s telescope was in
reality a new invention.</p>

<p>Certain other claimants of the invention of the
telescope, have appeared, besides those already
mentioned. Francis Fontana, in his ‘celestial
observations,’ says, that he was assured by a Mr.
Hardy, advocate of the parliament of Paris, a
person of great learning and undoubted integrity,
that on the death of his father, there was found
among his things an old tube, by which distant
objects were distinctly seen, and that it was of a
date long prior to the telescope lately invented,
and had been kept by him as a secret. Mr. Leonard
Digges, a gentleman who lived near Bristol,
in the seventeenth century, and was possessed of
great and various knowledge, positively asserts in
his ‘<i>Stratoticos</i>,’ and in another work, that his
father, a military gentleman, had an instrument
which he used in the field, by which he could
bring distant objects near, and could know a
man at the distance of three miles. Mr. Thomas
Digges, in the preface to his ‘Pantometria,’ published
in 1591, declares, “My father, by his continual
painful practices, assisted by demonstrations
mathematical, was able, and sundry times hath by
proportional glasses, duly situate in convenient
angles, not only discovered things far off, read
letters, numbered pieces of money, with the very
coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of
his friends of purpose, upon downs in open fields,
but also, seven miles off, declared what hath been
done that instant, in private places. He hath
also, sundry times, by the sun-beams, fired
powder and discharged ordnance half a mile and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
more distant, and many other matters far more
strange and rare, of which there are yet living
divers witnesses.”</p>

<p>It is by no means unlikely, that persons accustomed
to reflection, and imbued with a certain
degree of curiosity, when handling spectacle-glasses,
and amusing themselves with their magnifying
powers and other properties, might sometimes
hit upon the construction of a telescope; as it
only requires two lenses of different focal distances
to be held at a certain distance from each
other, in order to show distant objects magnified.
Nay, even one lens, of a long focal distance, is
sufficient to constitute a telescope of a moderate
magnifying power, as I shall show in the sequel.
But such instruments, when they happened to be
constructed accidentally, appear to have been
kept as secrets, and confined to the cabinets of
the curious, so that they never came into general
use; and as their magnifying power would probably
be comparatively small, the appearance of the
heavenly bodies would not be much enlarged by
such instruments&mdash;nor is it likely that they would
be often directed to the heavens. On the whole,
therefore, we may conclude that the period when
instruments of this description came into general
use, and were applied to useful purposes, was when
Galileo constructed his first telescopes.

<h3 id="PART_II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h4 id="OF_THE_CAMERA_OBSCURA">OF THE CAMERA OBSCURA.</h4>

<p>Before proceeding to a particular description of
the different kinds of telescopes, I shall first give
a brief description of the Camera Obscura, as
the phenomena exhibited by this instrument tend
to illustrate the principle of a refracting telescope.</p>

<p>The term <i>Camera Obscura</i> literally signifies a
darkened vault or roof; and hence it came to denote
a chamber, or box, or any other place made
dark for the purpose of optical experiments. The
camera obscura, though a simple, is yet a very
curious and noble contrivance; as it naturally and
clearly explains the manner in which vision is
performed, and the principle of the telescope, and
entertains the spectator with a most exquisite picture
of surrounding objects, painted in the most
accurate proportions and colours by the hand of
nature. The manner of exhibiting the pictures
of objects in a dark room is as follows:&mdash;In one
of the window-shutters of a room which commands
a good prospect of objects not very distant,
a circular hole should be cut of four or five inches
diameter. In this hole an instrument should be
placed, called a <i>Scioptric ball</i>, which has three
parts, a frame, a ball, and a lens. The ball has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
a circular hole cut through the middle, in which
the lens is fixed, and its use is, to turn every way
so as to take in a view of objects on every side.
The chamber should be made perfectly dark; and
a white screen, or a large sheet of elephant paper,
should be placed opposite to the lens, and in its
focus, to receive the image. If then, the objects
without be strongly enlightened by the sun, there
will be a beautiful living picture of the scene delineated
on the white screen, where every object
is beheld in its proportions, and with its colours
even more vivid than life; green objects appear in
the picture more intensely green, and yellow, blue,
red or white flowers appear much more beautiful
in the picture than in nature; if the lens be a good
one, and the room perfectly dark, the perspective
is seen in perfection. The lights and shadows
are not only perfectly just, but also greatly heightened;
and, what is peculiar to this delineation,
and which no other picture or painting can exhibit&mdash;the
<i>motions</i> of all the objects are exactly expressed
in the picture; the boughs of the trees
wave, the leaves quiver, the smoke ascends in a
waving form, the people walk, the children at
their sports leap and run, the horse and cart move
along, the ships sail, the clouds soar and shift
their aspects, and all as natural as in the real
objects; the motions being somewhat quicker,
as they are performed in a more contracted scene.</p>

<p>These are the <i>inimitable</i> perfections of a picture,
drawn by the rays of light as the only pencil
in nature’s hand, and which are finished in a
moment; for no sensible interval elapses before
the painting is completed, when the ground on
which it is painted is prepared and adjusted. In
comparison of such a picture, the finest productions
of the most celebrated artists, the proportions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of Raphael, the natural tints and colouring
of Titian, and the shadowing of the Venetians,
are but coarse and sorry daubings, when set in
competition with what nature can exhibit by the
rays of light passing through a single lens. The
Camera obscura is at the same time the painter’s
assistant, and the painter’s reproach. From the
picture it forms he receives his best instructions,
and is shown what he should endeavour to attain;
and hence, too, he learns the imperfections of his
art, and what it is impossible for him to imitate.
As a proof of this, the picture formed in the dark
chamber will bear to be magnified to a great extent,
without defacing its beauty, or injuring the
fineness of its parts; but the finest painted landscape,
if viewed through a high magnifier will
appear only as a coarse daubing.</p>

<p>The following scheme will illustrate what has
been now stated respecting the dark chamber.
EF represents a darkened room, in the side of
which, IK, is made the circular hole V, in which,
on the inside, is fixed the scioptric ball. At some
considerable distance from this hole is exhibited
a landscape of houses, trees, and other objects,
ABCD, which are opposite to the window. The
rays which flow from the different objects which
compose this landscape, to the lens at V, and which
pass through it, are converged to their respective
foci, on the opposite wall of the chamber HG or
on a white moveable screen placed in the focus of
the lens, where they all combine to paint a lively
and beautiful picture of the range of objects
directly opposite, and on each side, so far as the
lens can take in.</p>

<p>Though I have said, that a scioptric ball and
socket are expedient to be used in the above experiment,
yet where such an instrument is not at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
hand, the lens may be placed in a short tube made
of pasteboard or any other material, and fixed in
the hole made in the window shutter. The only
imperfection attending this method is, that the
lens can exhibit those objects only which lie
directly opposite the window.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 37.</i></p>
<img id="fig037" src="images/fig037.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Some may be disposed to consider it as an imperfection
in this picture, that all the objects appear
in an <i>inverted</i> position; as they must necessarily
do, according to what we formerly stated respecting
the properties of convex lenses, (p. 72).
There are, however, different modes of viewing
the picture as if it were erect. For, if we stand
before the picture, and hold a common mirror
against our breast at an acute angle with the picture,
and look down upon it, we shall see all the
images of the objects as if restored to their erect
position; and by the reflection of the mirror, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
picture will receive such a lustre as will make it
still more delightful. Or, if a large concave mirror
were placed before the picture at such a distance,
that its image may appear before the mirror, it will
then appear erect and pendulous in the air in the
front of the mirror. Or, if the image be received on
a frame of paper, we may stand behind the frame,
with our face towards the window, and look down
upon the objects, when they will appear as if
erect.</p>

<p>The experiment of the Camera Obscura may
serve to explain and illustrate the nature of a
common refracting telescope. Let us suppose,
that the lens in the window-shutter represents the
object-glass of a refracting telescope. This glass
forms an image in its focus, which is in every
respect an exact picture or representation of the
objects before it; and consequently the same idea
is formed in the mind, of the nature, form, magnitude,
and colour of the object&mdash;whether the eye
at the centre of the glass views the object itself,
or the image formed in its focus. For, as formerly
stated, the object and its image are both
seen under the same angles by the eye placed at
the centre of the lens. Without such an image
as is formed in the camera obscura&mdash;depicted either
in the tube of a telescope or in the eye itself&mdash;no
telescope could possibly be formed. If we now
suppose that, behind the image formed in the
dark chamber, we apply a convex lens of a short
focal distance to view that image, then the image
will be seen distinctly, in the same manner as
we view common objects, such as a leaf or a
flower, with a magnifying glass; consequently, the
object itself will be seen distinct and magnified.
And, as the same image is nearer to one lens than
the other, it will subtend a larger angle at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
nearest lens, and of course, will appear larger than
through the other, and consequently the object
will be seen magnified in proportion. For example,
let us suppose the lens in the camera obscura,
or the object lens of a telescope, to be five feet,
or sixty inches focal distance, at this distance from
the glass, an image of the distant objects opposite
to it will be formed. If now, we place a small
lens two inches focal distance beyond this point,
or five feet two inches from the object-glass, the
objects, when viewed through the small lens, will
appear considerably magnified, and apparently
much nearer than to the naked eye. The degree
of magnifying power is in proportion to the focal
distances of the two glasses; that is, in the present
case, in the proportion of two inches, the
focus of the small lens, to sixty inches, the focus
of the object lens. Divide sixty by two, the
quotient is thirty, which gives the magnifying
power of such a telescope, that is, it represents
objects thirty times nearer, or under an angle thirty
times larger than to the naked eye. If the eye-glass,
instead of being two inches, were only one
and a half inch focus, the magnifying power would
be in the proportion of one and a half to sixty, or
forty times. If the eye-glass were three inches
focus, the magnifying power would be twenty
times; and so on, with regard to other proportions.
In all cases, where a telescope is composed of only
two convex lenses, the magnifying power is determined,
<i>by dividing the focal distance of the object-glass,
by the focal distance of the eye-glass</i>, and
the quotient expresses the number of times the
object is magnified, in length and breadth. This
and various other particulars, will be more fully
illustrated in the sequel.</p>

<p>In performing experiments with the camera
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
obscura in a darkened chamber, it is requisite that
the following particulars be attended to:&mdash;1. That
the lens be well figured, and free from any veins
or blemishes that might distort the picture. 2.
That it be placed <i>directly against</i> the object whose
image we wish to see distinctly delineated. 3.
The lens should be of a proper size both as to its
breadth and focal distance. It should not be less
than three or four feet focal distance, otherwise the
picture will be too small, and the parts of objects
too minute to be distinctly perceived; nor should
it exceed fifteen or eighteen feet, as in this case
the picture will be faint, and of course not so
pleasing. The best medium as to focal distance,
is from five to eight or ten feet. The aperture,
too, or breadth of the glass, should not be too
small, otherwise the image will be obscure, and
the minute parts of it invisible for want of a sufficient
quantity of light. A lens of six feet focal
distance, for example, will require an aperture of
at least two inches. Lenses of a shorter focal
distance require less apertures, and those of a
longer focal distance larger. But if the aperture
be too large, the image will be confused, and indistinct,
by the admission of too much light. 4.
We should never attempt to exhibit the images
of objects, unless when the sun is shining and
strongly illuminating the objects, except in the
case of very near objects placed in a good light.
As one of the greatest beauties, in the phenomena
of the dark chamber, consists in the exquisite
appearance and contrast of light and shadows,
nothing of this kind can be perceived but from
objects directly illuminated by the sun. 5. A
south window should never be used in the forenoon,
as the sun cannot then enlighten the north
side of an object; and besides, his rays would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
apt to shine upon the lens, which would make the
picture appear with a confused lustre. An east
window is best in the afternoon, and a western in
the morning; but a north window is in most cases
to be preferred, especially in the forenoon, when
the sun is shining with his greatest strength and
splendour. In general, that window ought to be
used which looks to the quarter opposite to that
in which the sun is shining.</p>

<p>The picture should be received upon a very
white surface, as the finest and whitest paper, or
a painted cloth, bordered with black; as white
bodies reflect most copiously the incident rays,
while black surfaces absorb them. If the screen
could be bent into the concave segment of a
sphere, of which the focal distance of the double
convex lens which is used, is the radius, the parts
of the picture adjacent to the extremities would
appear most distinct. Sir D. Brewster informs
us that, having tried a number of white substances
of different degrees of smoothness, and several
metallic surfaces, on which to receive the image,
he happened to receive the picture on the silvered
back of a looking-glass, and was surprised at the
brilliancy and distinctness with which external
objects were represented. To remove the spherical
protuberances of the tin foil, he ground the
surface very carefully with a bed of hones which
he had used for working the plane specula of
Newtonian telescopes. By this operation, which
may be performed without injuring the other side
of the mirror, he obtained a surface finely adapted
for the reception of images. The minute parts
of the landscape were formed with so much precision,
and the brilliancy of colouring was so
uncommonly fine, as to equal, if not exceed the
images that are formed in the air by means of
concave specula.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>The following additional circumstances may be
stated respecting the phenomena exhibited in the
dark chamber. A more critical idea may be
formed of any <i>movement</i> in the picture here presented
than from observing the motion of the
object itself. For instance, a man walking in a
picture appears to have an undulating motion, or
to rise up and down every step he takes, and the
hands seem to move almost exactly like a pendulum;
whereas scarcely any thing of this kind is
observed in the man himself, as viewed by the
naked eye. Again, if an object be placed just
twice the focal distance from the lens without
the room, the image will be formed at the
same distance from the lens within the room,
and consequently will be equal in magnitude
to the object itself. The recognition of this
principle may be of use to those concerned in
drawing, and who may wish, at any time, to
form a picture of the exact size of the object.
If the object be placed further from the lens than
twice its focal length, the image will be less than
the object. If it be placed nearer, the image will
be greater than the life. In regard to immoveable
objects, such as houses, gardens, trees, &amp;c., we may
form the images of so many different sizes, by
means of different lenses, the shorter focus making
the lesser picture, and the longer focal distance the
largest.</p>

<p>The experiments with the camera obscura, may
likewise serve to illustrate the nature of vision,
and the functions of the human eye. The frame
or socket of the scioptric ball may represent the
<i>orbit</i> of the natural eye. The ball, which turns
every way, resembles the <i>globe</i> of the eye, moveable
in its orbit. The hole in the ball may represent
the <i>pupil</i> of the eye; the convex lens corresponds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
to the <i>crystalline humour</i>, which is
shaped like a lens, and contributes to form the
images of objects on the inner part of the eye.
The dark chamber itself, is somewhat similar to
the <i>internal part of the eye</i>, which is lined all
around, and under the retina, with a membrane,
over which is spread a mucous of a very black
colour. The white wall or frame of white paper to
receive the picture of objects, is a fair representation
of the <i>retina</i> of the eye, on which all the
images of external objects are depicted. Such
are some of the general points of resemblance between
the apparatus connected with the dark
chamber, and the organ of vision; but the human
eye is an organ of such exquisite construction, and
composed of such a number and variety of delicate
parts, that it cannot be adequately represented by
any artificial contrivance.</p>

<p>The darkened chamber is frequently exhibited
in a manner somewhat different from what we have
above described, as in the following scheme, (fig.
38) which is termed the <i>revolving camera obscura</i>.
In this construction, KH represents a plane mirror
or metallic reflector, placed at half a right angle
to the convex lens HI, by which, rays proceeding
from objects situated in the direction O are reflected
to the lens, which forms an image of the
objects on a round white table at T, around which
several spectators may stand, and view the picture,
as delineated on a horizontal plane. The
reflector, along with its case, is capable of being
turned round, by means of a simple apparatus
connected with it, so as to take in, in succession,
all the objects which compose the surrounding
scene. But as the image here is received on a
flat surface, the rays <i>fm</i>, <i>en</i>, will have to diverge
farther than the central rays <i>dc</i>; and hence the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
representation of the object, near the sides, will
be somewhat distorted; to remedy which, the image
should be received on a concave surface, as <i>ab</i> or
PS. This is the general plan of those Camera
Obscuras, fitted up in large wooden tents, which
are frequently exhibited in our large cities, and
removed occasionally from one town to another.
Were an instrument of this kind fitted up on a
<i>small scale</i>, a hole might be made in one of the
sides, as at E, where the eye could be applied
to view the picture. The focal distances of the
lenses used in large instruments of this kind, are
generally from eight to twelve feet, in which case
they produce a telescopic effect upon distant objects,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
so as to make them appear nearer than when
viewed with the naked eye.</p>

</div>

<p>The camera obscura is frequently constructed
in a <i>portable form</i>, so as to be carried about for
the purpose of delineating landscapes. The following
is a brief description of the instrument in
this form. AC is a convex lens placed near the
end of a tube or drawer, which is moveable in the
side of a square box, within which is a plane
mirror DE, reclining backward in an angle of
forty-five degrees from the perpendicular <i>pn</i>.
The pencils of rays flowing from the object OB,
and passing through the convex lens&mdash;instead of
proceeding forward and forming the image HI,
are reflected upward by the mirror, and meet in
points as FG, at the same distance at which they
would have met at H and I, if they had not been
intercepted by the mirror. At FG, the image of
the object OB is received either on a piece of
oiled paper, or more frequently on a plane <i>unpolished</i>
glass, placed in the horizontal situation
FG, which receives the images of all objects,
opposite to the lens, and on which, or on an oiled
paper placed upon it, their outlines may be traced
by a pencil. The moveable tube on which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
lens is fixed, serves to adjust the focus for near
and distant objects, till their images appear distinctly
painted on the horizontal glass at FG.
Above is shown the most common form of the box
of this kind of Camera Obscura. A is the position
of the lens, BC, the position of the mirror, D,
the plane unpolished glass on which the images
are depicted, GH a moveable top or screen to
prevent the light from injuring the picture, and
EF, the moveable tube.</p>

<p id="THE_DAGUERREOTYPE"><i>The Daguerreotype.</i>&mdash;An important, and somewhat
surprising discovery has lately been made,
in relation to the picture formed by the Camera
Obscura. It is found, that the images formed by
this instrument are capable of being indelibly fixed
on certain surfaces previously prepared for the
purpose, so that the picture is rendered permanent.
When a Camera is presented to any object
or landscape strongly illuminated by the sun, and
the prepared ground for receiving the image is adjusted,
and a certain time allowed to elapse till the
rays of light produce their due effect, in a few
minutes or even seconds, a picture of the objects
opposite to the lens is indelibly impressed upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the prepared plate, in all the accurate proportions
and perspective, which distinguish the images
formed in a dark chamber&mdash;which representations
may be hung up in apartments, along with other
paintings and engravings; and will likely retain
their beauty and lustre for many years. These
are pictures of nature’s own workmanship finished
in an extremely short space of time, and with the
most exquisite delicacy and accuracy. The effect
is evidently owing to certain chemical properties
in the rays of light; and opens a new field for
experiment and investigation to the philosopher.
The only defect in the picture is, that it is not
coloured; but, in the progress of experiments on
this subject, it is not unlikely that even this object
may be accomplished, in which case, we should
be able to obtain the most accurate landscapes and
representations of all objects, which can possibly
be formed. This art or discovery goes by the
name of the <i>Daguerreotype</i> from M. Daguerre,
a Frenchman, who is supposed to have been the
first discoverer, and who received a large premium
from the French government for disclosing the
process, and making the discovery public. Several
improvements and modifications, in reference to
the preparation of the plates, have been made since
the discovery was first announced, about the beginning
of 1839; and the pictures formed on this
principle, are frequently distinguished by the name
of <i>Photogenic</i> drawings; and are now exhibited at
most of our public scientific institutions.</p>

<p>This new science or art, has been distinguished
by different names. It was first called <i>Photography</i>,
from two Greek words, signifying <i>writing by
light</i>: it was afterwards called the art of <i>Photogenic
Drawing</i>, or drawing produced by light. M.
Daguerre gave it the name of <i>Heliography</i>, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
<i>writing by the sun</i>, all which appellatives are derived
from the Greek, and are expressive, in some
degree, of the nature of the process. We shall,
however, make use of the term Daguerreotype,
derived from the name of the inventor.</p>

<p>As it does not fall within our plan to give any
minute descriptions of the Daguerreotype process,
we shall just give a few general hints in reference
to it, referring those who wish for particular details,
to the separate treatises which have been
published respecting it. The first thing necessary
to be attended to in this art is, the preparation of
the plate on which the drawing is to be made. The
plate consists of a thin leaf of copper, plated with
silver; both metals together, not being thicker
than a card. The object of the copper is simply
to support the silver, which must be the purest
that can be procured. But though the copper
should be no thicker than to serve the purpose of
support, it is necessary that it should be so thick
as to prevent the plate from being warped, which
would produce a distortion of the images traced
upon it. This plate must be polished;&mdash;and for
this purpose, the following articles are required&mdash;a
phial of olive oil&mdash;some very fine cotton&mdash;pumice-powder,
ground till it is almost impalpable, and
tied up in a piece of fine muslin, thin enough to
let the powder pass through without touching the
plate when the bag is shaken. A little nitric acid
diluted with sixteen times, by measure, its own
quantity of water&mdash;a frame of wire on which to
place the plate, when being heated&mdash;a spirit lamp
to make the plate hot&mdash;a small box with inclined
sides within, and having a lid to shut it up close&mdash;and
a square board large enough to hold the
drawing, and having catches at the side to keep it
steady.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>To the above prerequisites, a good <i>Camera
Obscura</i> is, of course, essentially necessary. This
instrument should be large enough to admit the
plate of the largest drawing intended to be taken.
The lens which forms the image of the object,
should, if possible, be <i>achromatic</i>, and of a considerable
diameter. In an excellent instrument
of this description, now before me, the lens is an
achromatic, about 3 inches diameter, but capable
of being contracted to a smaller aperture. Its
focal distance is about 17 inches; and the box,
exclusive of the tube which contains the lens, is
15 inches long, 13&frac12; inches broad, and 11 inches
deep. It forms a beautiful and well-defined picture
of every well-enlightened object to which it
is directed.</p>

<p>Before the plate is placed in the camera, there
are certain operations to be performed. 1. The
surface of the plate should be made perfectly
smooth, or highly polished. For this purpose, it
must be laid flat, with the silver side upwards,
upon several folds of paper for a bedding; and
having been well polished in the usual way, the
surface must be powdered equally and carefully
with fine pumice enclosed in the muslin bag. Then
taking a little cotton wool, dipped in olive oil, it
must be rubbed over the plate with rounding
strokes, and then crossing them by others which
commence at right angles with the first. This
process must be repeated frequently, changing the
cotton, and renewing the pumice powder every
time. A small portion of cotton must now be
moistened with the diluted nitric acid, and applied
equally to the whole surface. The next thing to
be done is to make the plate thoroughly and
equally hot, by holding the plate with a pair of
pincers, by the corner, over a charcoal fire, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
when the plate is sufficiently hot, a white coating
will be observed on the silver, which indicates that
that part of the operation is finished. An even
cold surface is next wanted, such as a metallic
plate cooled almost to the freezing point by
muriate of soda, and to this the heated plate must
be suddenly transferred.</p>

<p>2. The next operation is to give the plate a
coating of <i>Iodine</i>. This is accomplished by fixing
the plate upon a board, and then putting it
into a box containing a little dish with iodine
divided into small pieces, with its face downward,
and supported with small brackets at the corners.
In this position, the plate must remain till it assume
<i>a full gold colour</i>, through the condensation
of the iodine on its surface&mdash;which process should
be conducted in a darkened apartment. The requisite
time for the condensation of the iodine
varies from five minutes to half an hour. When
this process is satisfactorily accomplished, the
plate should be immediately fixed in a frame with
catches and bands, and placed in the Camera; and
the transference from one receptacle to another
should be made as quickly as possible, and with
only so much light as will enable the operator to
see what he is doing.</p>

<p>3. The next operation is to obtain the drawing.
Having placed the Camera in front of the scene
to be represented, and the lens being adjusted to
the proper focus, the ground-glass of the Camera
is withdrawn, and the prepared plate is substituted
for it; and the whole is left till the natural
images are drawn by the natural light from the
object. The time necessary to leave the plate for
a complete delineation of the objects, depends upon
the intensity of the light. Objects in the shade
will require more time for their delineation than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
those in the broad light. The full clear light of
the south of Europe, Spain, Italy, and particularly,
the more glowing brilliancy of tropical countries,
will effect the object much more speedily
than the duller luminosity of a northern clime.
Some hours of the day are likewise more favourable
than others. Daguerre states, that ‘the most
favourable, is from 7 <small>A.M.</small> to 3 o’clock <small>P.M.</small>, and
that a drawing could be effected in Paris in 3 or
4 minutes, in June and July, which would require
5 or 6, in May and August, and 7 or 8 in April
and September.’ In the progress of this art, at
the present time, portraits and other objects are
frequently delineated in the course of a few
seconds.</p>

<p>4. Immediately after removing the plate from
the Camera, it is next placed over the vapour of
mercury, which is placed in a cup at the bottom
of a box, and a spirit lamp applied to its bottom,
till the temperature rise to 140 of Fahrenheit.
This process is intended to bring out the image,
which is not visible when withdrawn from the
Camera; but in the course of a few minutes a
faint tracery will begin to appear, and in a very
short time the figure will be clearly developed.</p>

<p>5. The next operation is <i>to fix the impression</i>.
In order to this, the coating on which the design
was impressed must be removed, to preserve it
from being decomposed by the rays of light. For
this purpose, the plate is placed in a trough containing
common water, plunging, and withdrawing
it immediately, and then plunging it into a solution
of salt and water, till the yellow coating has
disappeared.</p>

<p>Such is a very brief sketch of the <i>photogenic</i>
processes of Daguerre. Other substances, however,
more easily prepared, have been recommended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
by Mr. Talbot, F.R.S., who appears,
about the same time, to have invented a process
somewhat similar to that of Daguerre. The following
are his directions for the preparation of
<i>Photogenic Paper</i>.</p>

<p>The paper is to be dipped into a solution of
salt in water, in the proportion of half an ounce
of salt to half a pint of water. Let the superfluous
moisture drain off, and then, laying the
paper upon a clean cloth, <i>dab</i> it gently with a
napkin, so as to prevent the salt collecting in one
spot more than another. The paper is then to
be pinned down by two of its corners on a drawing
board, by means of common pins, and one
side washed or wetted with the Photogenic fluid,
using the brush prepared for that purpose, and
taking care to distribute it equally. Next dry
the paper as rapidly as you can at the fire, and it
will be fit for use for most purposes. If, when
the paper is exposed to the sun’s rays, it should
assume an irregular tint, a very thin extra wash
of the fluid will render the colour uniform, and at
the same time somewhat darker. Should it be
required to make a more sensitive description of
paper, after the first application of the fluid,
the solution of salt should be applied, and the
paper dried at the fire. Apply a second wash of
the fluid, and dry it at the fire again: employ the
salt a third time, dry it,&mdash;and one application more
of the fluid will, when dried, have made the paper
extremely sensitive. When slips of such papers,
differently prepared, are exposed to the action of
day light, those which are soonest affected by the
light, by becoming dark, are the best prepared.</p>

<p>When photogenic drawings are finished in a
perfect way, the designs then taken on the plate
or paper are exceedingly beautiful and correct,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
and will bear to be inspected with a considerable
magnifying power, so that the most minute portions
of the objects delineated may be distinctly
perceived. We have seen portraits, finished in
this way by a London artist, with an accuracy
which the best miniature painter could never
attempt&mdash;every feature being so distinct, as to
bear being viewed with a deep magnifier. And
in landscapes and buildings, such is the delicacy
and accuracy of such representations, that the
marks of the chisel and the crevices in the stones
may frequently be seen by applying a magnifying
lens to the picture; so that we may justly exclaim,
in the words of the Poet: ‘Who can paint
like nature!.’ That <small>LIGHT</small>&mdash;which is the first-born
of Deity, which pervades all space, and
illuminates all worlds&mdash;in the twinkling of an eye,
and with an accuracy which no art can imitate,
depicts every object in its exact form and proportions,
superior to every thing that human genius
can produce.</p>

<p>The Photogenic art, in its progress, will doubtless
be productive of many highly interesting
and beneficial effects. It affords us the power of
representing, by an accurate and rapid process,
all the grand and beautiful objects connected with
our globe&mdash;the landscapes peculiar to every
country&mdash;the lofty ranges of mountains which
distinguish Alpine regions&mdash;the noble edifices
which art has reared&mdash;the monumental remains of
antiquity&mdash;and every other object which it would
be interesting for human beings to contemplate;
so that in the course of time, the general scenery
of our world, in its prominent parts, might be
exhibited to almost every eye. The commission
of the French Chambers, when referring to this
art, has the following remark, ‘To copy the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
millions upon millions of hieroglyphics which cover
even the exterior of the great monuments of
Thebes and Memphis, of Carnac, &amp;c., would
require scores of years and legions of designers.
By the assistance of the Daguerreotype, a single
man could finish that immense work.’&mdash;This
instrument lays down objects, which the visual
organs of man would overlook, or might be unable
to perceive, with the same minuteness and nicety,
that it delineates the most prominent features of
a landscape. The time-stained excrescences on a
tree, the blades of grass, the leaf of a rose, the
neglected weed, the moss on the summit of a lofty
tower, and similar objects, are traced with the
same accuracy as the larger objects in the surrounding
scene.</p>

<p>It is not improbable, likewise, that this art (still
in its infancy) when it approximates to perfection,
may enable us to take representations of the sublime
objects in the heavens. The sun affords
sufficient light for this purpose; and there appears
no insurmountable obstacle in taking, in this way,
a highly magnified picture of that luminary,
which shall be capable of being again magnified
by a powerful microscope. It is by no means
improbable, from experiments that have hitherto
been made, that we may obtain an accurate
delineation of the lunar world from the moon herself.
The plated disks prepared by Daguerre
receive impressions from the action of the lunar
rays to such an extent as permits the hope that
photographic charts of the moon may soon be
obtained; and, if so, they will excel in accuracy all
the delineations of this orb that have hitherto been
obtained; and if they should bear a microscopic
power, objects may be perceived on the lunar
surface which have hitherto been invisible. Nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
is it impossible that the planets Venus, Mars,
Jupiter and Saturn, may be delineated in this
way, and objects discovered which cannot be
descried by means of the telescope. It might
perhaps be considered as beyond the bounds of
probability to expect that even distant <i>Nebul&aelig;</i>,
might thus be fixed, and a delineation of their
objects produced which shall be capable of being
magnified by microscopes. But we ought to consider
that the art is yet only in its infancy&mdash;that
plates of a more delicate nature than those
hitherto used, may yet be prepared, and that
other properties of light may yet be discovered,
which shall facilitate such designs. For, we ought
now to set no boundaries to the discoveries of
science, and to the practical applications of
scientific discovery which genius and art may
accomplish.</p>

<p>In short, this invention leads to the conclusion,
that we have not yet discovered all the wonderful
properties of that Luminous Agent which pervades
the universe, and which unveils to us its
beauties and sublimities&mdash;and that thousands of
admirable objects and agencies may yet be disclosed
to our view through the medium of light,
as philosophical investigators advance in their
researches and discoveries. In the present
instance, as well as in many others, it evidently
appears, that the Creator intends, in the course
of his providence, by means of scientific researches,
gradually to open to the view of the inhabitants of
our world the wonders, the beauties and the sublimities
of his vast creation, to manifest his infinite
wisdom, and his superabundant goodness, and to
raise our souls to the contemplation and the love
of Him who is the original source of all that is
glorious and beneficent in the scene of nature.

<h4 id="ON_THE_OPTICAL_ANGLE_AND_THE_APPARENT_MAGNITUDE_OF_OBJECTS">ON THE OPTICAL ANGLE, AND THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>In order to understand the principle on which
telescopes represent distant objects as magnified,
it may be expedient to explain what is meant by
the angle of vision, and the apparent magnitudes
under which different objects appear, and the same
object, when placed at different distances.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 40</i>*.</p>
<img id="fig040" src="images/fig040.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The optical angle is the angle contained under
two right lines drawn from the extreme points of
an object to the eye. Thus AEB or CED (fig.
40*.) is the optical or visual angle, or the angle
under which the object AB or CD, appears to the
eye at E. These two objects, being at different
distances, are seen under the same angle, although
CD is evidently larger than AB. On the retina
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of the eye, their images are exactly of the same
size, and so is the still larger object FG.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 41.</i></p>
<img id="fig041" src="images/fig041.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>apparent magnitude</i> of objects denotes
their magnitude as they appear to us, in contradistinction
from their real or true magnitude, and
it is measured by the visual angle; for whatever
objects are seen under the same or equal angles
<i>appear</i> equal, however different their real magnitudes.
If a half-crown or half-dollar be placed
at about 120 yards from the eye, it is just perceptible
as a visible point, and its apparent magnitude,
or the angle under which it is seen, is very small.
At the distance of thirty or forty yards, its bulk
appears sensibly increased, and we perceive it to
be a round body; at the distance of six or eight
yards, we can see the king or queen’s head engraved
upon it; and at the distance of eight or ten inches
from the eye it will appear so large, that it will
seem to cover a large building placed within the
distance of a quarter of a mile, in other words,
the apparent magnitude of the half-crown held at
such a distance, will more than equal that of such
a building, in the picture on the retina, owing to
the increase of the optical angle. If we suppose
A (fig. 41.) to represent the apparent size of the
half-crown at nine yards distance, then we say it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
is seen under the small angle FED. B will represent
its apparent magnitude at 4&frac12; yards distant
under the angle HEG, and the circle C, its apparent
magnitude at 3 yards distant, under the large
angle KEI.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 42.</i></p>
<img id="fig042" src="images/fig042.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This may be otherwise illustrated by the following
figure. Let AB (fig. 42.) be an object
viewed directly by the eye QR. From each extremity
A and B draw the lines AN,BM, intersecting
each other in the crystalline humour in I:
then is AIB the optical angle which is the measure
of the apparent magnitude or length of the object
AB. From an inspection of this figure, it will
evidently appear that the apparent magnitudes of
objects will vary according to their distances.
Thus AB, CD, EF, the real magnitudes of which
are unequal, may be situated at such distances
from the eye, as to have their <i>apparent</i> magnitudes
all equal, and occupying the same space on
the retina MN, as here represented. In like
manner, objects of equal magnitude, placed at
unequal distances, will appear unequal. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
objects AB and GH which are equal, being
situated at different distances from the eye, GH
will appear under the large angle TIV, or as large
as an object TV, situated at the same place as the
object AB, while AB appears under the smaller
angle AIB. Therefore the object GH is <i>apparently</i>
greater than the object AB, though it is
only equal to it. Hence it appears that we have
no certain standard of the <i>true magnitude</i> of
objects, by our visual perception abstractly considered,
but only of the <i>proportions</i> of magnitude.</p>

<p>In reference to apparent magnitudes, we scarcely
ever judge any object to be so great or so small as
it appears to be, or that there is so great a disparity
in the visible magnitude of two equal bodies
at different distances from the eye. Thus, for
example, suppose two men, each six feet 3 inches
high, to stand directly before us, one at the distance
of a pole, or 5&frac12; yards, and the other at the
distance of 100 poles, or 550 yards&mdash;we should
observe a considerable difference in their apparent
size, but we should scarcely suppose, at first sight,
that the one nearest the eye appeared a hundred
times greater than the other, or that, while the
nearest one appeared 6 feet 3 inches high, the
remote one appeared only about <i>three fourths of
an inch</i>. Yet such is in reality the case; and not
only so, but the visible bulk or area of the one is
to that of the other, as the square of these numbers,
namely as 10,000 to 1; the man nearest
us presenting to the eye a magnitude or surface
ten thousand times greater than that of the other.
Again, suppose two chairs standing in a large
room, the one 21 feet distance from us, and the
other 3 feet&mdash;the one nearest us will appear 7
times larger both in length and breadth, than the
more distant one, and consequently, its visible area
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
49 times greater. If I hold up my finger at 9
inches distant from my eye, it seems to cover a
large town a mile and a half in extent, situated at
3 miles distant; consequently, the apparent magnitude
of my finger, at 9 inches distant from the
organ of vision, is greater than that of the large
town at 3 miles distance, and forms a larger picture
on the retina of the eye. When I stand at
the distance of a foot from my window, and look
through one of the panes to a village less than
a quarter of a mile distant, I see, through that
pane, nearly the whole extent of the village, comprehending
two or three hundred houses; consequently,
the apparent magnitude of the pane is
equal to nearly the extent of the village, and all
the buildings it contains do not appear larger than
the pane of glass in the window, otherwise, the
houses and other objects which compose the
village could not be seen through that single pane.
For, if we suppose a line drawn from one end of
the village, passing through the one side of the
pane, and another line drawn from the other end,
and passing through the other side of the pane to
the eye, these lines would form the optical angle
under which the pane of glass and the village
appears. If the pane of glass be fourteen
inches broad, and the length of the village 2640
yards, or half a mile&mdash;this last lineal extent is
6,788 times greater than the other, and yet they
have the same <i>apparent</i> magnitude in the case
supposed.</p>

<p>Hence we may learn the absurdity and futility
of attempting to describe the extent of spaces in
the heavens, by saying, that a certain phenomenon
was two or three feet or yards distant from another,
or that the tail of a comet appeared several
yards in length. Such representations can convey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
no definite ideas in relation to such magnitudes,
unless it be specified at what distance from the
eye, the foot or yard is supposed to be placed. If
a rod, a yard in length, be held at nine inches
from the eye, it will subtend an angle, or cover a
space in the heavens, equal to more than one
fourth of the circumference of the sky, or about
one hundred degrees. If it be eighteen inches
from the eye, it will cover a space equal to fifty
degrees; if at three feet, twenty-five degrees, and
so on in proportion to the distance from the eye;
so that we can form no correct conceptions of
apparent spaces or distances in the heavens, when
we are merely told that two stars, for example,
appear to be three yards distant from each other.
The only definite measure we can use, in such
cases, is that of degrees. The sun and moon are
about half a degree in apparent diameter, and the
distance between the extreme stars in <i>Orion’s belt</i>,
three degrees, which measures being made familiar
to the eye, may be applied to other spaces of the
heavens, and an approximate idea conveyed of the
relative distances of objects in the sky.</p>

<p>From what has been stated above, it is evident
that the magnitude of objects may be considered
in different points of view. The true dimensions
of an object, considered in itself, give what is called
its <i>real</i> or <i>absolute magnitude</i>; and the opening of
the visual angle determines the <i>apparent magnitude</i>.
The real magnitude, therefore, is a constant
quantity; but the apparent magnitude varies continually
with the distance, real or imaginary; and
therefore, if we always judged of the dimensions
of an object from its apparent magnitude, every
thing around us would, in this respect, be undergoing
very sensible variations, which might lead
us into strange and serious mistakes. A fly, near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
enough to the eye, might appear under an angle
as great as an elephant at the distance of twenty
feet, and the one be mistaken for the other. A
giant eight feet high, seen at the distance of twenty-four
feet, would not appear taller than a child two
feet in height, at the distance of six feet; for
both would be seen nearly under the same angle.
But our experience generally prevents us from
being deceived by such illusions. By the help of
touch, and by making allowance for the different
distances at which we see particular objects, we
learn to correct the ideas we might otherwise form
from attending to the optical angle alone, especially
in the case of objects that are near us. By
the sense of touch we acquire an impression of the
distance of an object; this impression combines
itself with that of the apparent magnitude, so that
the impression which represents to us the real
magnitude is the product of these two elements.
When the objects, however, are at a great distance,
it is more difficult to form a correct estimate of
their true magnitudes. The visual angles are so
small, that they prevent comparison; and the
estimated bulks of the objects depend in a great
measure upon the <i>apparent</i> magnitudes; and thus
an object situated at a great distance, appears to
us much smaller than it is in reality. We also
estimate objects to be nearer or farther distant
according as they are more or less clear, and our
perception of them more or less distinct and well
defined; and likewise, when several objects intervene
between us and the object we are particularly
observing. We make a sort of addition of all
the estimated distances of intermediate objects, in
order to form a total distance of the remote object,
which in this case appears to be farther off than
if the intervening space were unoccupied. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
generally estimated that no terrestrial object can
be distinctly perceived, if the visual angle it subtends
be less than <i>one minute of a degree</i>; and
that most objects become indistinct, when the
angle they subtend at the pupil of the eye is less
than six minutes.</p>

<p>We have deemed it expedient to introduce the
above remarks on the apparent magnitude of objects,
because the principal use of a telescope is
to increase the angle of vision, or to represent
objects under a larger angle than that under
which they appear to the naked eye, so as to render
the view of distant objects more distinct, and
to exhibit to the organ of vision those objects
which would otherwise be invisible. A telescope
may be said to enlarge an object just as many
times as the angle under which the instrument
represents it, is greater than that under which it
appears to the unassisted eye. Thus the moon
appears to the naked eye under an angle of about
half a degree; consequently a telescope magnifies
60 times if it represents that orb under an angle
of 30 degrees; and if it magnified 180 times, it
would exhibit the moon under an angle of 90
degrees, which would make her appear to fill half
of the visible heavens, or the space which intervenes
from the horizon to the zenith.

<h4 id="ON_THE_DIFFERENT_KINDS_OF_REFRACTING_TELESCOPES">ON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF REFRACTING TELESCOPES.</h4>

<p>There are two kinds of telescopes, corresponding
to two modes of vision, namely, those which perform
their office by <i>refraction</i> through lenses, and
those which magnify distant objects by <i>reflection</i>
from mirrors. The telescope which is constructed
with lenses, produces its effects solely by refracted
light, and is called a Dioptric, <i>or refracting telescope</i>.
The other kind of telescope produces its
effects partly by reflection, and partly by refraction,
and is composed both of mirrors and lenses;
but the mirrors form the principal part of the
telescope; and therefore such instruments are
denominated <i>reflecting telescopes</i>. In this chapter
I shall describe the various kinds of <i>refracting</i>
telescopes.</p>

<h4 id="THE_GALILEAN_TELESCOPE">SECT 1.&mdash;THE GALILEAN TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>This telescope is named after the celebrated
Galileo, who first constructed, and probably
<i>invented</i> it in the year 1609. It consists of only
two glasses, a <i>convex</i> glass next the object, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
<i>concave</i> next the eye. The convex is called the
<i>object-glass</i>, and the concave to which the eye is
applied, is called the <i>eye-glass</i>. Let C (fig. 43.)
represent the convex object-glass, presented to
any object in the direction DEI, so that the rays
fall parallel upon it;&mdash;if these rays, after passing
through it, were not intercepted by the concave
lens K, they would pass on, and cross each other
in the focus F, where an inverted image of the
object would be formed. But the concave lens
K, the virtual focus of which is at F, being interposed,
the rays are not suffered to converge to
that point, but are made less convergent,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and
enter the pupil almost parallel, as GH, and are
converged by the humours of the eye to their
proper foci on the retina. The object, through
this telescope, is seen upright, or in its natural
position, because the rays are not suffered to come
to a focus, so as to form an inverted picture. The
concave eye-glass is placed as far within the focus
of the object-glass, as is equal to its own virtual
focus; and the magnifying power is as the focal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
length of the object-glass to that of the eye-glass,
that is, as CF to BF. Thus, suppose the focus
of the object-glass to be 10 inches, and the focus
of the eye-glass to be 1 inch, the magnifying
power will be 10 times&mdash;which is always found by
dividing the focal length of the object-glass by
that of the eye-glass. The interval between the
two glasses, in this case, will be 9 inches, which is
the length of the telescope, and the objects seen
through it will appear under an angle ten times
greater than they do to the naked eye. These
propositions might be proved mathematically; but
the process is somewhat tedious and intricate, and
might not fully be understood by general readers.
I shall therefore only mention some of the general
properties of this telescope, which is now seldom
used, except for the purpose of <i>opera-glasses</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 43</i></p>
<img id="fig043" src="images/fig043.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>1. The focal distance of the object-glass must
be greater than that of the eye-glass, otherwise it
would not magnify an object: if the focal distance
of the eye-glass were greater than that of the
object-glass, it would diminish objects, instead of
magnifying them. 2. The visible area of the
object is greater, the nearer the eye is to the
glass; and it depends on the diameter of the pupil
of the eye, and on the breadth of the object-glass;
consequently the field of view in this telescope is
very small. 3. The distinctness of vision in this
construction of a telescope exceeds that of almost
any other. This arises from the rays of light proceeding
from the object directly through the
lenses, <i>without crossing</i> or intersecting each other;
whereas in the combination of convex lenses, they
intersect one another to form an image in the
focus of the object-glass, and this image is magnified
by the eye-glass with all its imperfections and
distortions. The thinness of the centre of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
concave lens also contributes to distinctness. 4.
Although the field of view in this telescope is very
small, yet where no other telescope can be procured,
it might be made of such a length as to
show the spots on the Sun, the crescent of Venus,
the satellites of Jupiter, and the ring of Saturn;
and, requiring only two glasses, it is the cheapest
of all telescopes. It has been found that an object-lens
5 feet focal distance, will bear a concave
eye-glass of only 1 inch focal distance, and will
consequently magnify the diameters of the planets
60 times, and their surfaces 3600 times, which is
sufficient to show the phenomena now stated.
And, although only a small portion of the sun and
moon can be seen at once, yet Jupiter and all his
satellites may sometimes be seen at one view; but
there is some difficulty in finding objects with
such telescopes. 5. Opera-glasses, which are
always of this construction, have the object-lens
generally about 6 inches focus and 1 inch diameter,
with a concave eye-glass of about 2 inches
focus. These glasses magnify about 3 times in
diameter, have a pretty large field, and produce
very distinct vision. When adjusted to the eye,
they are about 4 inches in length. To the object
end of an opera-glass there is sometimes attached
a plane mirror, placed at an angle of 45 degrees,
for the purpose of viewing objects on either side
of us. By this means, in a theatre or assembly,
we can take a view of any person without his
having the least suspicion of it, as the glass is
directed in quite a different direction. The
instrument with this appendage is sometimes
called a <i>Polemoscope</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<h4 id="THE_COMMON_ASTRONOMICAL_REFRACTING_TELESCOPE">SECT. 2.&mdash;THE COMMON ASTRONOMICAL REFRACTING TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>The astronomical telescope is the most simple
construction of a telescope, composed of convex
lenses only, of which there are but two essentially
necessary, though a third is sometimes added to
the eye-piece for the purpose of enlarging the
field of view. Its construction will be easily
understood from a description of the following
figure. Its two essential parts are, an object-glass
AD, and an eye-glass EY, so combined in
a tube that the focus F of the object-glass is
exactly coincident with the focus of the eye-glass.
Let OB (fig. 44.) represent a distant object,
from which rays nearly parallel proceed to
the object-lens AD. The rays passing through
this lens will cross at F, and form an image of the
object at IM. This image forms as it were an
object to the eye-glass EY, which is of a short
focal distance, and the eye is thus enabled to contemplate
the object as if it were brought much
nearer than it is in reality. For the rays, which
after crossing proceed in a divergent state, fall
upon the lens EY, as if they proceeded from a real
object situated at F. All that is effected therefore,
by such a telescope is, to form an image of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
a distant object by means of the object-lens, and
then to give the eye such assistance as is necessary
for viewing that image as near as possible, so that
the angle it shall subtend at the eye shall be very
large compared with the angle which the object
itself would subtend in the same situation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 44.</i></p>
<img id="fig044" src="images/fig044.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here it may be expedient to explain, 1. how
this arrangement of glasses shows distant objects
distinctly, and 2. the reason why objects appear
magnified when seen through it. As to the first
particular, it may be proved as follows:&mdash;The
rays OA and BD, which are parallel before they
fall upon the object-glass, are by this glass refracted
and united at its focus: In order, then,
to distinct vision, the eye-glass must re-establish
the parallelism of the rays,&mdash;which is effected by
placing the eye-glass so that its focus may be at
F, and consequently the rays will proceed from
it parallel to each other and fall upon the eye in
that direction. For distinct vision is produced by
<i>parallel</i> rays. 2. The reason why the object
appears magnified will appear, if we consider that,
if the eye viewed the object from the centre of
the object-glass, it would see it under the angle
OCB; let OC and BC then be produced to the
focus of the glass, they will then limit the image
IM formed in the focus. If then, two parallel
rays are supposed to proceed to the eye-glass EY,
they will be converged to its focus H, and the eye
will see the image under the angle EHY. The
apparent magnitude of the object, therefore, as
seen by the naked eye, is to the magnitude of the
image as seen through the telescope, as OCB to
EHY, or as the distance CF to the distance FG,
in other words, <i>as the focal length of the object-glass
to that of the eye-glass</i>.</p>

<p>It is obvious from the figure, that, through this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
telescope, all objects will appear <i>inverted</i>; since
the object OB is depicted by the object-glass in
an inverted position at IM, and in this position
is viewed by the eye-glass EY; and, therefore
this kind of telescope is not well adapted for viewing
terrestrial objects, since it exhibits the tops
of trees, houses, and other objects as undermost,
and the heads of people as pointing downwards.
But this circumstance is of no consequence with
respect to the heavenly bodies, since they are
round, and it can make little difference to an observer
which side of a globular body appears
uppermost or undermost. All astronomical
refracting telescopes invert objects; but they are
preferred to any other telescopes, because they
have few glasses, and consequently more light.
This telescope however, can be transformed into
a common day telescope for land objects, by the
addition of two other eye-glasses, as we shall
afterwards explain; but in this case a quantity of
light is lost by refraction at each lens; for there
is scarcely any transparent substance that transmits
all the rays of light that fall upon it.</p>

<p>The <i>magnifying power</i> of this telescope is
found <i>by dividing the focal distance of the object-glass
by the focal distance of the eye-glass</i>: the
quotient gives the magnifying power, or the number
of times that the object seen through the
telescope, appears larger or nearer than to the
naked eye. Thus, for example, if the focal distance
of the object-glass be 28 inches, and the
focal distance of the eye-glass 1 inch, the magnifying
power will be 28 times. If we would enlarge
the telescope and select an object-glass 10 feet, or
120 inches focus, an eye-glass of 2 inches focal
length might be applied, and then the diameter
of objects would be magnified 60 times, and their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
surfaces 3600 times. If we would use an object-glass
of 100 feet, it would be necessary to select
an eye-glass about 6 inches focus, and the magnifying
power would be 200 times, equal to 1200
inches divided by 6. Since, then, the power of
magnifying depends on the proportion of the focal
length of the object and eye-glasses, and this proportion
may be varied to any degree, it may seem
strange to some that a short telescope of this kind
will not answer that purpose as well as a long one.
For instance, it may be asked why an object-glass
of 10 feet focus, may not be made to magnify as
much, as one of 100 feet focal length, by using an
eye-glass of half an inch focus, in which case, the
magnifying power would be 240 times? But it is
to be considered, that if the power of magnifying
be increased, while the length of the telescope
remains the same, it is necessary to diminish the
focal length of the eye-glass in the same proportion,
and this cannot be done on account of the great
distortion and colouring which would then appear
in the image, arising both from the deep convexity
of the lens and the different refrangibility of the
rays of light. It is found that the length of common
refracting telescopes must be increased in
proportion to the square of the increase of their
magnifying power; so that in order to magnify
twice as much as before, with the same light and
distinctness, the telescope must be lengthened
four times; to magnify 3 times as much, 9 times;
and to magnify four times as much, sixteen times;
that is&mdash;suppose a telescope of 3 feet to magnify
33 times,&mdash;in order to procure a power four times
as great, or 132 times, we must extend the telescope
to the length of 48 feet, or 16 times the
length of the other. Much likewise depends upon
the breadth or aperture of the object-glass. If it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
be too small, there will not be sufficient light to
illuminate the object; and if it be too large, the
redundance of light will produce confusion in the
image.</p>

<p>The following table, constructed originally by
Huygens, and which I have re-calculated and corrected,
shows the linear aperture, the focal distance
of the eye-glass, and the magnifying power
of astronomical telescopes of different lengths,
which may serve as a guide to those who wish to
construct telescopes of this description.</p>

<p>In the above table, the first column expresses the
focal length of the object-glass in feet; the second
column, the diameter of the aperture<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
object-glass, the third column, the focal distance
of the eye-glass, and the fourth, the magnifying
power, which is found by reducing the feet in the
first column to inches, and dividing by the numbers
in the third column. From this table it
appears that, in order to obtain a magnifying
power of 168 times, by this kind of telescope, it
is requisite to have an object-glass of 70 feet focal
distance, and an eye-glass five inches focus, and that
the aperture of the object-glass ought not to be
more than about 4&frac12; inches diameter. To obtain a
power of 220 times requires a length of 120
feet.</p>

<p>The following is a summary view of the properties
of this telescope. 1. The object is always
inverted. 2. The magnifying power is always in
the proportion of the focal distance of the object-glass
to the eye-glass. 3. As the rays emerging
from the eye-glass, should be rendered parallel for
every eye, there is a small sliding tube next the
eye, which should be pushed out or in till the
object appears distinct. When objects are pretty
near, this tube requires to be pulled out a little.
These circumstances require to be attended to in
all telescopes. 4. The apparent magnitude of an
object is the same wherever the eye be placed,
but the visible area, or field of view, is the greatest
when the eye is nearly at the focal distance
of the eye-glass. 5. The visual angle depends on
the breadth of the eye-glass; for it is equal to
the angle which the eye-glass subtends at the
object-glass; but the breadth of the eye-glass
cannot be increased beyond a certain limit, without
producing colouring and distortion.</p>

<p>If the general principles on which this telescope
is constructed be thoroughly understood, it
will be quite easy for the reader to understand the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
construction of all the other kinds of telescopes,
whether refracting or reflecting. A small astronomical
telescope can be constructed in a few
moments, provided one has at hand the following
lenses:&mdash;1. A common reading-glass, eight or ten
inches focal distance; 2. A common magnifying
lens, such as watchmakers or botanists use, of
about 1&frac12; or 2 inches focus. Hold the reading-glass&mdash;suppose
of ten inches focus&mdash;in the left
hand opposite any object, and the magnifying lens
of two inches focus, in the right hand near the
eye, at twelve inches distance from the other in a
direct line, and a telescope is formed which magnifies
five times. I have frequently used this
plan, when travelling, when no other telescope was
at hand.</p>

<h4 id="THE_AERIAL_TELESCOPE">SECT. 3.&mdash;THE AERIAL TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>The Aerial is a refracting telescope of the kind
we have now described, intended to be used without
a tube in a dark night; for the use of a tube is
not only to direct the glasses, but to make the
place dark where the images are formed. It
appears from the preceding table inserted above,
that we cannot obtain a high magnifying power,
with the common astronomical telescope, without
making it of an extreme length, in which case the
glasses are not manageable in tubes&mdash;which are
either too slight and apt to bend, or too heavy and
unwieldy if made of wood, iron or other strong
materials. The astronomers of the seventeenth
century, feeling such inconveniences in making
celestial observations with long tubes, contrived a
method of using the glasses without tubes. Hartsocker,
an eminent optician, contrived to fix them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
at the top of a tree, a high wall, or the roof of a
house; but the celebrated Huygens, who was not
only an astronomer, but also an excellent mechanic,
made considerable improvements in the
method of using an object-glass without a tube.
He placed it at the top of a very long pole, having
previously enclosed it in a short tube, which was
made to turn in all directions by means of a ball
and socket. The axis of this tube he could command
with a fine silken string, so as to bring it
into a line with the axis of another short tube
which he held in his hand, and which contained
the eye-glass. The following is a more particular
description of one of these telescopes. On the
top of a long pole or mast <i>ab</i> (fig. 45), is fixed a
board moveable up and down in the channel <i>cd</i>:
<i>e</i> is a perpendicular arm fixed to it, and <i>ff</i> is a
transverse board that supports the object glass
enclosed in the tube <i>i</i>, which is raised or lowered
by means of the silk cord <i>rl</i>; <i>gg</i> is an endless
rope with a weight <i>h</i>, by which the apparatus of
the object-glass is counterpoised; <i>kl</i> is a stick
fastened to the tube <i>i</i>; <i>m</i> the ball and socket, by
means of which the object-glass is moveable every
way: and to keep it steady, there is a weight <i>n</i>
suspended by a wire; <i>l</i> is a short wire to which
the thread <i>rl</i> is tied; <i>o</i> is the tube which holds
the eye-glass; <i>q</i> the stick fixed to this tube, <i>s</i> a
leaden bullet, and <i>t</i> a spool to wind the thread
on; <i>u</i> is pins for the thread to pass through; <i>x</i> the
rest for the observer to lean upon, and <i>y</i> the lantern.
Fig. 46 is an apparatus contrived by M. de
la Hire for managing the object-glass; but which
it would be too tedious particularly to describe.
To keep off the dew from the object-glass, it was
sometimes included in a pasteboard tube, made of
spongy paper, to absorb the humidity of the air.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
And to find an object more readily, a broad annulus
of white pasteboard was put over the tube
that carried the eye-glass; upon which the image
of the object being painted, an assistant who
perceived it, might direct the tube of the eye-glass
into its place.</p>

<p>Such was the construction of the telescopes with
which Hevelius, Huygens, Cassini, and other
eminent astronomers of the seventeenth century
made their principal discoveries. With such
telescopes, Huygens discovered the fourth satellite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
of Saturn, and determined that this planet was
surrounded with a ring; and with the same kind
of instrument Cassini detected the first, second,
third, and fifth, satellites of Saturn, and made his
other discoveries. When the night was very dark,
they were obliged to make the object-glass visible,
by means of a lantern so constructed as to throw
the rays of light up to it in a parallel direction.
In making such observations, they must have
taken incredible pains, endured much cold and
fatigue, and subjected themselves to very great
labour and expense&mdash;which almost makes us
wonder at the discoveries they were instrumental
in bringing to light&mdash;and should make modern
philosophers sensible of the obligations they are
under to such men as Newton and Dollond, through
whose inventions such unwieldy instruments are
no longer necessary. Telescopes of the description
now stated were made of all sizes, from 30
to above 120 feet in length. Divini at Rome,
and Campani at Bologna, were famed as makers
of the object-glasses of the long focal distance to
which we have alluded, who sold them for a great
price, and took every method to keep the art of
making them a secret. It was with telescopes
made by Campani, that Cassini made his discoveries.
They were made by the express order of
Louis XIV, and were of 86, 100, and 136 Paris
feet in focal length. M. Auzout made one object-glass
of 600 feet focus; but he was never able to
manage it, so as to make any practical observations
with it. Hartsocker is said to have made
some of a still greater focal length. The famous
aerial telescope of Huygens was 123 feet in focal
length, with six inches of aperture. At his death,
he bequeathed it to the Royal Society of London,
in whose possession it still remains. It required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
a pole of more than a hundred feet high, on which
to place the object-glass for general observations.
It was with this glass, that Dr. Derham made the
observations to which he alludes in his preface to
his ‘Astro-Theology.’ When this glass was in
the possession of Mr. Cavendish, it was compared
with one of Mr. Dollond’s forty-six inch treble
object-glass Achromatics, and the gentlemen who
were present at the trial, said that ‘the Dwarf was
fairly a match for the Giant.’ It magnified 218
times, and the trouble of managing it, was said to
be extremely tiresome and laborious.</p>

<h4 id="THE_COMMON_REFRACTING_TELESCOPE_FOR_TERRESTRIAL_OBJECTS">SECT. 4.&mdash;THE COMMON REFRACTING TELESCOPE FOR TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.</h4>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 47.</i></p>
<img id="fig047" src="images/fig047.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This telescope is constructed on the same principle
as the astronomical telescope already described,
with the addition of two or three glasses.
In fig. 47, OB represents a distant object, LN,
the object glass, which forms the image IM in its
focus, which is, of course, in an inverted position,
and, if the eye were applied at the lens EE, the
object would appear, exactly as through the astronomical
telescope, every object being apparently
turned upside down. To remedy this inconvenience,
there are added two other glasses FF
and GG, by which a second image is formed from
the first, in the same position as the object. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
order to effect this, the first of these two glasses,
namely FF, is placed at twice its focal distance
from the former glass EE, and the other lens GG,
next the eye, is placed at the same distance from
FF. For all the three glasses are supposed to be
of the same focal distance. Now, the lens FF,
being placed at twice the focal distance for parallel
rays from EE, receives the pencils of parallel
rays after they have crossed each other at X, and
forms an image at <i>i m</i> similar to that at IM and
equal to it, but contrary in position, and consequently
erect; which last image is viewed by
the lens GG, in the same manner as the first
image IM would be viewed by the lens EE. In
this case, the image IM is considered as an object
to the lens FF of which it forms a picture
in its focus, in a reverse position from that of the
first image, and of course, in the same position as
the object.</p>

<p>The magnifying power of this telescope is determined
precisely in the same way as that of the
astronomical telescope. Suppose the object-glass
to be thirty inches focal distance, and each of the
eye-glasses 1&frac12; inch focal distance, the magnifying
power is in the proportion of 30 to 1&frac12;, or 20 times,
and the instrument is, of course, considerably
longer than an astronomical telescope of the same
power. The distance, in this case, between the
object-glass and the first eye-glass EE is 31&frac12;
inches; the distance between EE, and the second
glass FF, is 3 inches, and the distance between
FF and the glass GG next the eye, 3 inches;
in all 37&frac12; inches, the whole length of the telescope.
Although it is usual to make use of three eye-glasses
in this telescope, yet two will cause the
object to appear erect, and of the same magnitude.
For suppose the middle lens FF taken away, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
the first lens EE be placed at X, which is double
its focal distance from the image IM, it will at
the same distance X <i>m</i>, on the other side, form a
secondary image <i>i m</i> equal to the primary image
IM, and also in a contrary position. But such a
combination of eye-glasses produces a great degree
of colouring in the image, and therefore is seldom
used. Even the combination now described, consisting
of three lenses of equal focal distances, is
now almost obsolete, and has given place to a much
better arrangement consisting of <i>four</i> glasses, of
different focal distances&mdash;which shall be afterwards
described.</p>

<p>The following figures, 48, 49, 50 represent the
manner in which the rays of light are refracted
through the glasses of the telescopes we have now
described. Fig. 48 represents the rays of light as
they pass from the object to the eye in the Galilean
telescope. After passing in a parallel direction
to the object-glass, they are refracted by that
glass, and undergo a slight convergence in passing
towards the concave eye-glass, where they enter
the eye in a parallel direction, but no image is
formed previous to their entering the eye, till they
arrive at the retina. Fig. 49 represents the rays
as they pass through the glasses of the astronomical
telescope. The rays, after entering the object-glass,
proceed in a converging direction, till they
arrive at its focus, about A, where an image of the
object is formed; they then proceed diverging to
the eye-glass, where they are rendered parallel,
and enter the eye in that direction. Fig. 50 represents
the rays as they converge and diverge in
passing through the four glasses of the common
day-telescope described above. After passing
through the object-glass, they converge towards
B, where the first image is formed. They then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
diverge towards the first eye-glass where they are
rendered parallel; and passing through the second
eye-glass, they again converge and form a second
image at C; from which point they again diverge,
and passing through the first eye-glass enter the
eye in a parallel direction. If the glasses of these
telescopes were fixed on long pieces of wood, at
their proper distances from each other, and placed
in a darkened room, when the sun is shining, the
beam of the sun’s light would pass through them
in the same manner as here represented.</p>

<h4 id="TELESCOPE_FORMED_BY_A_SINGLE_LENS">SECT. 5.&mdash;TELESCOPE FORMED BY A SINGLE LENS.</h4>

<p>This is a species of telescope altogether unnoticed
by optical writers, so far as I know; nor
has the property of a single lens in magnifying
distant objects been generally adverted to or recognised.
It may not therefore be inexpedient to
state a few experiments which I have made in
relation to this point. When we hold a spectacle-glass
of a pretty long focal distance&mdash;say, from 20
to 24 inches&mdash;close to the eye, and direct it to
distant objects, they do not appear sensibly magnified.
But if we hold the glass about 12 or 16
inches from our eye, we shall perceive a sensible
degree of magnifying power, as if distant objects
were seen at less than half the distance at which
they are placed. This property of a spectacle-glass
I happened to notice when a boy, and, on
different occasions since that period have made
several experiments on the subject, some of which
I shall here relate.</p>

<p>With the object-glass of a common refracting
telescope 4&frac12; feet focal distance, and 2&frac12; inches
diameter, I looked at distant objects&mdash;my eye
being at about 3&frac12; feet from the lens, or about 10
or 12 inches within its focus&mdash;and it produced
nearly the same effect as a telescope which magnifies
the diameters of objects 5 or 6 times. With
another lens 11 feet focal distance and 4 inches diameter&mdash;standing
from it at the distance of about
10 feet, I obtain a magnifying power of about
12 or 14 times, which enables me to read the
letters on the sign-posts of a village half a mile
distant. Having some time ago procured a very
large lens 26 feet focal distance, and 11&frac12; inches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
diameter, I have tried with it various experiments
of this kind upon different objects. Standing at
the distance of about 25 feet from it, I can see
distant objects through it magnified about 26 times
in diameter, and consequently 676 times in surface,
and remarkably clear and distinct, so that I can
distinguish the hour and minute hands of a public
clock in a village two miles distant. This single
lens, therefore answers the purpose of an ordinary
telescope with a power of 26 times. In making
such experiments our eye must always be <i>within</i>
the focus of the lens, at least 8 or 10 inches.
The object will, indeed, be seen at any distance
from the glass within this limit; but the magnifying
power is diminished in proportion as we approach
nearer to the glass. Different eyes, too,
will require to place themselves at different distances,
so as to obtain the greatest degree of magnifying
power with distinctness, according as individuals
are long or short-sighted.</p>

<p>This kind of telescope stands in no need of a
tube, but only of a small pedestal on which it may
be placed on a table, nearly at the height of the
eye, and that it be capable of a motion in a perpendicular
or parallel direction, to bring it in a
line with the eye and the object. The principle
on which the magnifying power, in this case, is
produced, is materially the same as that on which
the performance of the Galilean telescope depends.
The eye of the observer serves instead of the concave
lens in that instrument; and as the concave
lens is placed as much within the focus of the
object-glass, as is equal to its own focal distance,
so the eye, in these experiments, must be placed
at least its focal distance within the focus of
the lens with which we are experimenting;
and the magnifying power will be nearly in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
proportion of the focal distance of the lens to the
focal distance of the eye. If, for example, the
focal distance of the eye, or the distance at which
we see to read distinctly, be 10 inches, and the
focal distance of the lens, 11 feet, the magnifying
power will be as 11 feet, or 132 inches to 10, that
is, about 13 times. Let A (fig. 51.) represent
the lens placed on a pedestal; the rays of light
passing through this lens from distant objects
will converge towards a focus at F. If a person
then, place his eye at E, a certain distance within
the focal point, he will see distant objects magnified
nearly in the proportion of the focal distance
of the lens to that of the eye; and when the lens
is very broad&mdash;such as the 26 feet lens mentioned
above&mdash;two or three persons may look through it
at once, though they will not all see the same
object. I have alluded above to a lens made by
M. Azout of 600 feet focal distance. Were it
possible to use such a lens for distant objects, it
might represent them as magnified 5 or 600 times,
without the application of any eye-glass. In this
way the aerial telescope of Huygens would magnify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
objects above 100 times, which is about
half the magnifying power it produced with its
eye-piece. Suppose Azout’s lens had been fitted
up as a telescope, it would not have magnified
above 480 times, as it would have required an eye-glass
of 14 or 15 inches focal distance, whereas,
without an eye-glass, it would have magnified
objects considerably above 500 times. It is not
unlikely that the species of telescope to which I
have now adverted, constituted one of those instruments
for magnifying distant objects which
were said to have been in the possession of certain
persons long before their invention in Holland,
and by Galileo in Italy&mdash;to which I have referred
in p. 182. Were this kind of telescope to be
applied to the celestial bodies, it would require to be
elevated upon a pole in the manner represented,
fig. 45, p. 226.</p>

<h4 id="THE_ACHROMATIC_TELESCOPE">SECT. 6.&mdash;THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>This telescope constitutes the most important
and useful improvement ever made upon telescopic
instruments; and, it is probable, it will, ere long,
supersede the use of all other telescopes. Its
importance and utility will at once appear when
we consider, that a good achromatic telescope of
only 4 or 5 feet in length will bear a magnifying
power as great, as that of a common astronomical
telescope 100 feet long, and even with a greater
degree of distinctness, so that they are now come
into general use both for terrestrial and celestial
observations. There are, indeed, certain obstructions
which prevent their being made of a very
large size; but from the improvement in the
manufacture of achromatic glass which is now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
going forward, it is to be hoped that the difficulties
which have hitherto impeded the progress of
opticians will soon be removed. In order to understand
the nature of this telescope, it will be
necessary to advert a little to the <i>imperfections</i>
connected with common refracting telescopes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 52.</i></p>
<img id="fig052" src="images/fig052.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first imperfection to which I allude is this,
that <i>spherical surfaces do not refract the rays of
light accurately to a point</i>; and hence the image
formed by a single convex lens is not perfectly
accurate and distinct. The rays which pass near
the extremities of such a lens meet in foci nearer
to the lens than those which pass nearly
through the centre, which may be illustrated by
the following figure. Let PP (fig. 52) be a convex
lens and E<i>e</i> an object, the point E of which corresponds
with the axis, and sends forth the rays
EM, EN, EA, &amp;c., all of which reach the surface
of the glass, but in different parts. It is manifest
that the ray EA which passes through the middle
of the glass, suffers no refraction. The rays EM,
EM, likewise, which pass through near to EA,
will be converged to a focus at F, which we generally
consider as the focus of the lens. But the
rays EN, EN, which are nearer to the edge of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
glass will be differently refracted, and will meet
about G, nearer to the lens, where they will form
another image G<i>g</i>. Hence, it is evident, that the
first image F<i>f</i>, is formed only by the union of
those rays which pass very near the centre of the
lens; but as the rays of light proceeding from
every point of an object are very numerous, there
is a succession of images formed, according to the
parts of the lens where they penetrate, which
necessarily produces indistinctness and confusion.
This is the imperfection which is distinguished by
the name of <i>spherical aberration</i>, or the error
arising from the spherical form of lenses.</p>

<p>The second and most important imperfection
of single lenses, when used for the object-glasses
of telescopes, is, that the rays of compounded
light being differently refrangible, come to their
respective foci at different distances from the glass;
the more refrangible rays, as the <i>violet</i>, converging
sooner than those which are less refrangible,
as the <i>red</i>. I have had occasion to illustrate this
circumstance, when treating on the colours produced
by the prism, (see p. 128, and figures 32
and 33,) and it is confirmed by the experiment of
a paper painted red, throwing its image, by means
of a lens, at a greater distance than another paper
painted blue. From such facts and experiments,
it appears, that the image of a white object consists
of an indefinite number of coloured images,
the violet being nearest, and the red farthest from
the lens, and the images of intermediate colours
at intermediate distances. The aggregate, or
image itself, must therefore be in some degree
confused; and this confusion being much increased
by the magnifying power, it is found necessary to
use an eye glass of a certain limited convexity to
a given object glass. Thus, an object glass of 34
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
inches focal length will bear an eye-glass of only
1 inch focus, and will magnify the diameters of
objects 34 times; one of 50 feet focal distance
will require an eye-glass of 4&frac12; inches focus, and
will magnify only 142 times; whereas, could we
apply to it an eye-glass of only 1 inch focus, as in
the former case, it would magnify no less than
600 times. And were we to construct an object-glass
of 100 feet focal length, we should require to
apply an eye-glass, not less than 6 inches focus,
which would produce a power of about 200 times;
so that there is no possibility of producing a great
power by single lenses, without extending the
telescope to an immoderate length.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, after having made his discoveries
respecting the colours of light, considered
the circumstance we have now stated as an insuperable
barrier to the improvement of refracting
telescopes; and therefore turned his attention to
the improvement of telescopes by <i>reflection</i>. In
the telescopes which he constructed and partly
invented, the images of objects are formed by
reflection from speculums or mirrors; and being
free from the irregular convergency of the various
coloured rays of light, will admit of a much
larger aperture and the application of a much
greater degree of magnifying power. The reflector
which Newton constructed was only 6 inches long,
but it was capable of bearing a power equal to
that of a 6 feet refractor. It was a long time,
however, after the invention of these telescopes
before they were made of a size fitted for making
celestial observations. After reflecting telescopes
had been some time in use, Dollond made his
famous discovery of the principle which led him
to the construction of the <i>achromatic</i> telescope.
This invention consists of a compound object glass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
formed of two different kinds of glass, by which
both the spherical aberration and the errors
arising from the different refrangibility of the rays
of light are, in a great measure corrected. For
the explanation of the nature of this compound
object glass and of the effects it produces; it may
be expedient to offer the following remarks
respecting the dispersion of light and its refraction
by different substances.</p>

<p>The <i>dispersion</i> of light is estimated by the
variable angle formed by the red and violet rays
which bound the solar spectrum;&mdash;or rather, it is
the excess of the refraction of the most refrangible
ray above that of the least refrangible ray. The
dispersion is not proportional to the refraction&mdash;that
is, the substances which have an equal mean
refraction, do not <i>disperse</i> light in the same ratio.
For example, if we make a prism with plates of
glass, and fill it with oil of Cassia, and adjust its
refracting angle ACB, (fig. 31, p. 127,) so that the
middle of the spectrum which it forms falls exactly
at the same place where the green rays of a spectrum
formed by a glass prism would fall&mdash;then we
shall find that the spectrum formed by the <i>oil of
Cassia</i> prism will be two or three times <i>longer</i>
than that of the <i>glass</i> prism. The oil of Cassia,
therefore, is said to <i>disperse</i> the rays of light more
than the glass, that is, to separate the extreme
red and violet rays at O and P more than the
mean ray at <i>green</i>, and to have a greater <i>dispersive
power</i>. Sir I. Newton appears to have made
use of prisms composed of different substances,
yet, strange to tell, he never observed that they
formed spectrums, whose lengths were different,
when the refraction of the green ray was the
same; but thought that the dispersion was proportional
to the refraction. This error continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
to be overlooked by philosophers for a considerable
time, and was the cause of retarding the
invention of the achromatic telescope for more
than 50 years.</p>

<p>Dollond was among the first who detected this
error. By his experiments it appears, that the
different kinds of glass differ extremely with
respect to the divergency of colours produced by
equal refractions. He found that two prisms,
one of white flint glass, whose refracting angle
was about 25 degrees, and another of crown glass
whose refracting angle was about 29 degrees,
refracted the beam of light nearly alike; but that
the divergency of colour in the white flint was
considerably more than in the crown glass; so
that when they were applied together, to refract
contrary ways, and a beam of light transmitted
through them, though the emergent continued
parallel to the incident part, it was, notwithstanding,
separated into component colours. From
this he inferred, that, in order to render the
emergent beam white, it is necessary that the
refracting angle of the prism of crown glass should
be <i>increased</i>, and by repeated experiments he discovered
the exact quantity. By these means he
obtained a theory in which refraction was performed
without any separation or divergency of
colour; and thus the way was prepared for applying
the principle he had ascertained to the construction
of the object glasses of refracting telescopes.
For the edges of a convex and concave
lens, when placed in contact with each other, may
be considered as two prisms which refract contrary
ways; and if the excess of refraction in the one
be such as precisely to destroy the divergency of
colour in the other, a colourless image will be
formed. Thus, if two lenses are made of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
same focal length, the one of flint glass and the
other of crown, the length or diameter of the
coloured image in the first will be to that produced
by the crown glass, as 3 to 2 nearly. Now, if
we make the focal lengths of the lenses in this
proportion, that is, as 3 to 2, the coloured spectrum
produced by each will be equal. But if the
flint lens be concave, and the crown convex&mdash;when
placed in contact&mdash;they will mutually correct
each other, and a pencil of white light
refracted by the compound lens will remain
colourless.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 53.</i></p>
<img id="fig053" src="images/fig053.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following figure may perhaps illustrate
what has been now stated. Let LL (fig. 53.)
represent a convex lens of <i>crown glass</i>, and <i>ll</i> a
concave lens of <i>flint glass</i>. A ray of the sun S,
falls at F on the convex lens which will refract it
exactly as the prism ABC, whose faces touch the
two surfaces of the lens at the points where the
ray enters and quits it. The solar ray, SF, thus
refracted by the lens LL, or prism ABC, would
have formed a spectrum PT on the wall, had there
been no other lens, the violet ray F crossing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
axis of the lens at V, and going to the upper end
P of the spectrum; and the red ray FR, going to
the lower end T. But as the flint-glass lens <i>ll</i>, or
the prism A<i>a</i>C which receives the rays FV, FR,
at the same points, is interposed, these rays will
be united at <i>f</i>, and form a small circle of white
light; the ray SF of the sun being now refracted
without colour from its primitive direction SFY
into the new direction F<i>f</i>. In like manner the
corresponding ray SM will be refracted to <i>f</i>, and
a white and colourless image of the sun will be
there formed by the two lenses. In this combination
of lenses it is obvious that the spherical aberration
of the flint lens corrects to a considerable
degree that of the crown-glass, and by a proper
adjustment of the radii of the surfaces, it may be
almost wholly removed. This error is still more
completely corrected in the <i>triple</i> achromatic
object-glass, which consists of three lenses&mdash;a
concave flint lens placed between convexes of
crown glass. Fig. 54 shows the <i>double</i> achromatic
lens, and fig. 55, the <i>triple</i> object-glass, as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
are fitted up in their cells, and placed at the object
end of the telescope. In consequence of their
producing a focal image free of colour they will
bear a much larger aperture and a much greater
magnifying power than common refracting telescopes
of the same length. While a common
telescope whose object-glass is 3&frac12; feet focal distance
will bear an aperture of scarcely 1 inch, the
3&frac12; feet Achromatic will bear an aperture of 3&frac14;
inches, and consequently transmits 10&frac12; times the
quantity of light. While the one can bear a magnifying
power of only about 36 times, the other
will bear a magnifying power for celestial objects
of more than 200 times.</p>

<p>The theory of the achromatic telescope is somewhat
complicated and abstruse, and would require
a more lengthened investigation than my limits
will permit. But what has been already stated
may serve to give the reader a general idea of the
<i>principle</i> on which it is constructed, which is all
I intended. The term <i>achromatic</i> by which such
instruments are now distinguished was first given
to them by Dr. Bevis. It is compounded of two
Greek words which signify, ‘free of colour.’
And, were it not that even philosophers are not
altogether free of that pedantry which induces us
to select Greek words which are unintelligible to
the mass of mankind, they might have been contented
with selecting the plain English word
<i>colourless</i>, which is as significant and expressive as
the Greek word <i>achromatic</i>. The <i>crown-glass</i>,
of which the convex lenses of this telescope are
made, is the same as good common window-glass;
and the <i>flint-glass</i> is that species of glass of which
wine-glasses, tumblers, decanters and similar
articles are formed, and is sometimes distinguished
by the name of crystal-glass. Some opticians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
have occasionally formed the concave lens of an
achromatic object-glass from the bottom of a
broken tumbler.</p>

<p>This telescope was invented and constructed by
Mr. John Dollond, about the year 1758. When
he began his researches into this subject, he was a
silk weaver in Spitalfields, London. The attempt
of the celebrated Euler to form a colourless telescope,
by including water between two meniscus
glasses, attracted his attention, and, in the year
1753, he addressed a letter to Mr. Short, the optician,
which was published in the Philosophical
Transactions of London, ‘concerning a mistake
in Euler’s theorem for correcting the aberrations
in the object glasses of refracting telescopes.’
After a great variety of experiments on the refractive
and dispersive powers of different substances,
he at last constructed a telescope in which
an exact balance of the opposite dispersive powers
of the crown and flint lenses made the colours
disappear, while the predominating refraction of
the crown lens disposed the achromatic rays to
meet at a distant focus. In constructing such
object glasses, however, he had several difficulties
to encounter. In the first place, the focal distance
as well as the particular surfaces must be
very nicely proportioned to the densities or refractive
powers of the glasses, which are very
apt to vary in the same sort of glass made at
different times. In the next place, the centers of
the two glasses must be placed truly in the common
axis of the telescope, otherwise the desired
effect will be in a great measure destroyed. To
these difficulties is to be added&mdash;that there are
four surfaces (even in double achromatic object
glasses) to be wrought perfectly spherical; and
every person practised in optical operations will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
allow, that there must be the greatest accuracy
throughout the whole work. But these and other
difficulties were at length overcome by the judgment
and perseverance of this ingenious artist.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that Dollond was not the
only person who had the merit of making this
discovery&mdash;a private gentleman, Mr. Chest, of
Chest-hall, a considerable number of years before,
having made a similar discovery, and applied
it to the same purpose. This fact was ascertained
in the course of a process raised against Dollond
at the instance of Watkins, optician at Charing-cross,
when applying for a patent. But as the
other gentleman had kept his invention a secret,
and Dollond had brought it forth for the benefit
of the public, the decision was given in his favour.
There was no evidence that Dollond borrowed
the idea from his competitor, and both were, to
a certain extent, entitled to the merits of the
invention.</p>

<p>One of the greatest obstructions to the construction
of large achromatic telescopes is, the
difficulty of procuring large discs of flint glass
of an uniform refractive density&mdash;of good colour,
and free from veins. It is said that, fortunately
for Mr. Dollond, this kind of glass was procurable
when he began to make achromatic telescopes,
though the attempts of ingenious chemists have
since been exerted to make it without much success.
It is also said, that the glass employed by
Dollond in the fabrication of his best telescopes,
was of the same melting, or made at the same
time, and that, excepting this particular treasure,
casually obtained, good dense glass for achromatic
purposes, was always as difficult to be procured
as it is now. The dispersion of the flint glass,
too, is so variable, that, in forming an achromatic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
lens, trials on each specimen require to be made
before the absolute proportional dispersion of the
substances can be ascertained. It is owing, in a
great measure, to these circumstances, that a large
and good achromatic telescope cannot be procured
unless at a very high price. Mr. Tulley of Islington&mdash;who
has been long distinguished as a maker
of excellent achromatic instruments&mdash;showed me,
about six years ago, a rude piece of flint glass
about five inches diameter, intended for the concave
lens of an achromatic object glass, for which
he paid eight guineas. This was before the piece
of glass was either figured or polished, and, consequently,
he had still to perform the delicate
operation of figuring, polishing, and adjusting this
concave to the convex lenses with which it was to
be combined; and during the process some veins
or irregularities might be detected in the flint
glass which did not then appear. Some years before,
he procured a disc of glass from the continent
about seven or eight inches diameter, for
which he paid about thirty guineas, with which
an excellent telescope, twelve feet focal length,
was constructed for the Astronomical Society of
London. It is obvious therefore, that large achromatic
telescopes must be charged at a pretty high
price.</p>

<p>In order to stimulate ingenious chemists and
opticians to make experiments on this subject, the
Board of Longitude, more than half a century
ago, offered a considerable reward for bringing the
art of making good flint glass for optical purposes
to the requisite perfection. But considerable difficulties
arise in attempting improvements of this
kind; as the experiments must all be tried on a
very large scale, and are necessarily attended with
a heavy expence. And although government has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
been extremely liberal in voting money for warlike
purposes, and in bestowing pensions on those who
stood in no need of them, it has hitherto thrown
an obstruction in the way of such experiments, by
the heavy duty of excise, which is rigorously exacted,
whether the glass be manufactured into
saleable articles or not; and has thus been instrumental
in retarding the progress of improvement
and discovery. It would appear that experiments
of this kind have been attended with more success
in France, Germany, and other places on the
continent, than in Britain; as several very large
achromatic telescopes have been constructed in
those countries by means of flint glass which was
cast for the purpose in different manufactories,
and to which British artists have been considerably
indebted; as the London opticians frequently purchase
their largest discs of flint glass from Parisian
agents. Guinaud, a continental experimenter,
and who was originally a cabinet maker, appears
to have had his labours in this department of art
crowned with great success. Many years were
employed in his experiments, and he too frequently,
notwithstanding all his attention, discovered
his metal to be vitiated by stri&aelig;, spects or
grains, with cometic tails. He constructed a furnace
capable of melting two <i>cwt</i> of glass in one
mass, which he sawed vertically, and polished one
of the sections, in order to observe what had taken
place during the fusion. From time to time, as
he obtained blocks, including portions of good
glass, his practice was to separate them by sawing
the blocks into horizontal sections, or perpendicular
to their axes. A fortunate accident conducted
him to a better process. While his men were
one day carrying a block of this glass, on a hand-barrow,
to a saw mill which he had erected at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Fall of the Doubs, the mass slipped from its
bearers, and, rolling to the bottom of a steep
and rocky declivity, was broken to pieces. Guinaud
having selected those fragments which appeared
perfectly homogeneous, softened them in circular
moulds, in such a manner, that on cooling, he obtained
discs that were afterwards fit for working.
To this method he adhered, and contrived a way
for clearing his glass while cooling, so that the
fractures should follow the most faulty parts.
When flaws occurred in the large masses, they
were removed by cleaving the pieces with wedges;
then smelting them again in moulds, which give
them the form of discs. The Astronomical
Society of London have made trial of discs made
by Guinaud, and have found them entirely homogeneous
and free from fault. Of this ingenious
artist’s flint glass, some of the largest achromatic
telescopes on the continent have been constructed.
But, it is more than twenty years since this experimenter
took his flight from this terrestrial scene,
and it is uncertain whether his process be still
carried on with equal success.</p>

<h4 id="NOTICES_OF_SOME_LARGE_ACHROMATIC_TELESCOPES_ON_THE_CONTINENT_AND_IN_GREAT_BRITAIN"><i>Notices of some large Achromatic telescopes on the
Continent and in Great Britain.</i></h4>

<p>1. <i>The Dorpat Telescope.</i>&mdash;This is one of the
largest and most expensive Refracting telescopes
ever constructed. It was made by the celebrated
Fraunhofer of Munich for the observatory of the
Imperial University of Dorpat, and was received
into the observatory by Professor Struve in the
year 1825. The aperture of the object glass of
this telescope is 9&frac12; English inches, and its solar
focal length about fourteen feet, the main tube
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
being thirteen French feet exclusive of the tube
which holds the eye pieces. The smallest of the
four magnifying powers it possesses, is 175, and
the largest 700, which, in favourable weather, is
said to present the object with the utmost precision.
‘This instrument,’ says Struve, ‘was sold
to us by Privy-Counsellor <span class="smcap">Von Utzchneider</span>,
the chief of the optical establishment at Munich,
for 10,500 florins, (about &pound;950 sterling), a price
which only covers the expenses which the establishment
incurred in making it.’ The frame work
of the stand of this telescope is of oak inlaid with
pieces of mahogany in an ornamental manner, and
the tube is of deal veneered with mahogany and
highly polished. The whole weight of the telescope
and its counterpoises is supported at one
point, at the common center of gravity of all its
parts; and though these weigh 3000 Russian
pounds, yet, we are told that this enormous telescope
may be turned in every direction towards the
heavens with more ease and certainty than any
other hitherto in use. When the object end of
the telescope is elevated to the zenith, it is sixteen
feet four inches, Paris measure, above the floor,
and its eye end in this position is two feet nine
inches high. This instrument is mounted on an
Equatorial stand, and clock work is applied to the
Equatorial axis, which gives it a smooth and
regular sidereal motion, which, it is said, keeps
a star in the exact center of the field of view,
and produces the appearance of a state of rest in
the starry regions, which motion can be made
solar, or even lunar, by a little change given to
the place of a pointer, that is placed as an index
on the dial plate. Professor Struve considers the
optical powers of this telescope superior to those
of Schr&ouml;eter’s twenty-five feet reflector, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
having observed σ Orionis with fifteen companions,
though Schr&ouml;eter observed only twelve, that he
could count with certainty. Nay, he seems disposed
to place it in competition with the late Sir
W. Herschel’s forty feet reflector. The <i>finder</i>
of this telescope has a focal distance of 30 French
inches, and 2-42 aperture.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sir James South’s Telescope.</i>&mdash;About the
year 1829, Sir J. South, President of the London
Astronomical Society, procured of M. Cauchoix
of Paris, an achromatic object glass of 11<sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches,
clear aperture, and of 19 feet focal length. The
flint glass employed in its construction was the
manufacture of the late Guinaud le Pere, and
was found to be absolutely perfect. The first observation
was made with this telescope, while on a
temporary stand, on Feb. 13, 1830, when Sir J.
Herschel discovered with it a <i>sixth</i> star in the
trapezium in the nebula of Orion, whose brightness
was about one third of that of the fifth star discovered
by Struve, which is as distinctly seen as
the companion to Polaris is in a five feet achromatic.
Sir James gives the following notices of
the performance of this instrument on the morning
of May 14, 1830. ‘At half past two, placed the
20 feet achromatic on the Georgium Sidus, saw
it with a power of 346, a beautiful planetary disc;
not the slightest suspicion of any ring, either perpendicular
or horizontal; but the planet three
hours east of the meridian, and the moon within
three degrees of the planet.’ At a quarter before
three, viewed <i>Jupiter</i> with 252 and 346, literally
covered with belts, and the diameters of his satellites
might have been as easily measured as himself.
One came from behind the body, and the
contrast of the colour with that of the planet’s
limb was striking. At three o’clock viewed <i>Mars</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
The contrast of light in the vicinity of the poles
very decided. Several spots on his body well and
strongly marked&mdash;that about the south pole seems
to overtake the body of the planet, and gives an
appearance not unlike that afforded by the new
moon, familiarly known as ‘the old moon in the
new moon’s arms.’ <i>Saturn</i> has been repeatedly
seen with powers from 130 to 928 under circumstances
the most favourable; but not any thing
anomalous about the planet or its ring could even
be suspected. This telescope is erected on an
Equatorial stand at Sir J. South’s observatory,
Kensington.</p>

<p>3. <i>Captain Smyth’s Telescope in his private
observatory at Bedford.</i>&mdash;This Achromatic telescope
is 8&frac12; feet focal length, with a clear aperture
of 5<sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches worked by the late Mr. Tulley,
Senior, from a disk purchased by Sir James South
at Paris. It is considered by Captain Smyth to
be the finest specimen of that eminent optician’s
skill, and, it is said, will bear with distinctness, a
magnifying power of 1200. Its distinctness has
been proved by the clear vision it gives of the
obscure nebul&aelig;, and of the companions of Polaris,
Rigel, α Lyr&aelig;, and the most minute double stars&mdash;-the
lunar mountains, cavities and shadows under
all powers&mdash;the lucid polar regions of Mars&mdash;the
sharpness of the double ring of Saturn&mdash;the gibbous
aspect of Venus&mdash;the shadows of Jupiter’s
satellites across his body, and the splendid contrast
of colours in α Hercules, γ Andromed&aelig; and other
superb double stars.</p>

<p><i>Other large Achromatics.</i>&mdash;Besides the above,
the following, belonging to public observatories
and private individuals, may be mentioned. In
the Royal observatory at Greenwich, there is an
Achromatic of 10 feet focal distance, having a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
double object glass 5 inches diameter, which was
made by Mr. Peter Dollond, and the only one
of that size he ever constructed. There is also a
46 inch achromatic, with a triple object glass 3&frac34;
inches aperture, which is said to be the most perfect
instrument of the kind ever produced. It
was the favourite instrument of Dr. Maskelyne,
late Astronomer Royal, who had a small room
fitted up in the observatory for this telescope.
The observatory, some years ago erected near
Cambridge, is perhaps the most splendid structure
of the kind in Great Britain. It is furnished with
several very large achromatic telescopes on Equatorial
machinery: but the Achromatic telescope,
lately presented to it by the Duke of Northumberland,
is undoubtedly the largest instrument of
this description which is to be found in this
country. The object glass is said to be 25 feet
focal distance, and of a corresponding diameter,
but as there was no access to this instrument at
the time I visited this observatory, nearly six
years ago, I am unable to give a particular description
of it. In the Royal Observatory at
Paris, which I visited in 1837, I noticed, among
other instruments, two very large Achromatic
telescopes which, measuring them rudely by the
eye&mdash;I estimated to be from 15 to 18 feet long,
and the aperture at the object end, from 12 to 15
inches diameter. They were the largest achromatics
I had previously seen; but I could find no
person in the observatory at that time, who
could give me any information as to their history,
or to their exact dimensions, or powers of magnifying.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Pearson, Treasurer to the Astronomical
Society of London, is in possession of
the telescope formerly alluded to, made by Mr.
Tulley, of twelve feet focal distance and seven
inches aperture, which is said to be a very fine
one. The small star which accompanies the pole
star, with a power of a 100, appears through this
telescope, as distinct and steady as one of Jupiter’s
satellites. With a single lens of 6 inches
focus, which produced a power of 24 times,
according to the testimony of an observer who
noticed it&mdash;the small star appeared as it does in
an achromatic of 3 inches aperture, which shows
the great effect of illuminating power in such
instruments. Mr. Lawson, a diligent astronomical
observer in Hereford, possesses a most beautiful
achromatic telescope of about 7 inches aperture,
and 12 feet focal distance, which was made by one
of the Dollonds, who considered it as his <i>chief
d’oeuvre</i>. It is said to bear powers as high as
1100 or 1400; and has been fitted up with
mechanism devised by Mr. Lawson himself, so
as to be perfectly easy and manageable to the
observer, and which displays this gentleman’s inventive
talent. In several of his observations
with this instrument, he is said to have had a
view of some of the more minute subdivisions of
the ring of Saturn. A very excellent achromatic
telescope was fitted up some years ago by
my worthy friend William Bridges, Esq., Blackheath.
Its object glass is 5&frac12; inches diameter,
and about 5&frac12; feet focal length. It is erected upon
Equatorial machinery, and placed in a circular
observatory which moves round with a slight
touch of the hand. The object glass of this instrument
cost about 200 Guineas, the equatorial
machinery on which it is mounted cost 150
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Guineas, and the circular observatory in which it
is placed about 100 Guineas; in all 450 Guineas.
Its powers vary from 50 to 300 times.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<h4 id="ACHROMATIC_TELESCOPES_OF_A_MODERATE_SIZE"><i>Achromatic telescopes of a moderate size.</i></h4>

<p>Such telescopes as I have alluded to above, are
among the largest which have yet been made on
the achromatic principle; they are, of course,
comparatively rare, and can be afforded only at a
very high price. Few of the <i>object glasses</i> in
the telescopes to which I have referred, would be
valued at less than 200 Guineas, independently of
the tubes, eye pieces and other apparatus with
which they are fitted up. It is so difficult to procure
large discs of flint glass for optical purposes,
to produce the requisite curves of the different
lenses, and to combine them together with that
extreme accuracy which is requisite, that when a
good compound lens of this description is found
perfectly achromatic, the optician must necessarily
set a high value upon it; since it may happen
that he may have finished half a dozen before he
has got one that is nearly perfect. The more
common sizes of achromatic telescopes for astronomical
purposes, which are regularly sold by the
London opticians, are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The 2&frac12; feet Achromatic.</i>&mdash;This telescope
has an object glass 30 inches in focal length, and
2 inches clear aperture. It is generally furnished
with two eye pieces, one for terrestrial objects,
magnifying about 30 or 35 times, and one for
celestial objects with a power of 70 or 75 times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
It might be furnished with an additional astronomical
eye-piece&mdash;if the object glass be a good
one, so as to produce a power of 90 or 95 times.
With such a telescope, the belts and satellites
of Jupiter, the phases of Venus and the ring of
Saturn may be perceived; but not to so much
advantage as with larger telescopes. It is generally
fitted up either with a mahogany or a brass
tube, and is placed upon a tripod brass stand, with
a universal joint which produces a horizontal
and vertical motion. It is packed, along with
the eye-pieces, and whatever else belongs to it,
in a neat mahogany box. Its price varies, according
as it is furnished with an elevating rack or other
apparatus.</p>

<p>2. <i>The 3&frac12; feet Achromatic Telescope.</i>&mdash;The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
object glass of this telescope is from 44 to 46
inches focal length, and 2&frac34; inches diameter. It
is generally furnished with four eye-pieces, two
for terrestrial and two for celestial objects. The
lowest power for land objects is generally about
45, which affords a large field of view, and exhibits
the objects with great brilliance. The
other terrestrial power is usually from 65 to 70.
The astronomical powers are about 80 and 130;
but such a telescope should always have another
eye-piece, to produce a power of 180 or 200 times,
which it will bear with distinctness, in a serene
state of the atmosphere, if the object glass be
truly achromatic. The <i>illuminating power</i> in this
telescope is nearly double that of the 2&frac12; feet
telescope, or in the proportion of 7, 56 to 4; and
therefore it will bear about double the magnifying
power with nearly equal distinctness. This telescope
is fitted up in a manner somewhat similar to
the former, with a tripod stand which is placed
upon a table. Sometimes, however, it is mounted
on a long mahogany stand which rests upon the
floor, (as in fig. 58.), and is fitted with an equatorial
motion; and has generally a small telescope
fixed near the eye end of the large tube, called a
<i>finder</i>, which serves to direct the telescope to a
particular object in the heavens when the higher
powers are applied. It is likewise eligible that it
should have an elevating rack and sliding tubes,
for supporting the eye end of the instrument, to
keep it steady during astronomical observations,
and it would be an advantage, for various purposes
which shall be afterwards described, to have fitted
to it a <i>Diagonal Eye Piece</i> magnifying 40 times
or upwards.</p>

Tulley’s Catalogue, are as follows:&mdash;

<p>This is the telescope which I would particularly
recommend to astronomical amateurs, whose pecuniary
resources do not permit them to purchase
more expensive instruments. When fitted up
with the eye pieces and powers already mentioned,
and with a finder and elevating rack,&mdash;price 25
guineas&mdash;it will serve all the purposes of general
observation. By this telescope, satisfactory views
may be obtained of most of the interesting phenomena
of the heavens, such as the spots of the
sun&mdash;the mountains, vales, and caverns on the
lunar surface&mdash;the phases of Mercury and Venus&mdash;the
spots on Mars&mdash;the satellites and belts of
Jupiter&mdash;the ring of Saturn&mdash;many of the more
interesting nebul&aelig;, and most of the double stars
of the second and third classes. When the object
glass of this telescope is accurately figured and perfectly
achromatic, a power of from 200 to 230 maybe
put upon it, by which the division of Saturn’s
ring might occasionally be perceived. It is more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
easily managed and represents objects considerably
brighter than reflecting telescopes of the same
price and magnifying power, and it is not so apt
to be deranged as reflectors generally are. A
telescope of a less size would not in general be
found satisfactory for viewing the objects I have
now specified, and for general astronomical purposes.
It may not be improper for the information
of some readers, to explain what is meant in
Mr. Tulley’s catalogue, when it is stated that this
instrument has ‘one eye piece for day objects, <i>to
vary the magnifying power</i>.’ The eye piece
alluded to is so constructed, that by drawing out
a tube next the eye, you may increase the power
at pleasure, and make it to vary, say from 40 to
80 or 100 times; so that such a construction of
the terrestrial eye piece (to be afterwards explained)
serves in a great measure, the purpose of separate
eye-pieces. The whole length of the 3&frac12; feet telescope,
when the terrestrial eye piece is applied, is
about 4&frac12; feet from the object glass to the first eye
glass.</p>

<p>When the aperture of the object glass of this
telescope exceeds 2&frac34; inches its price rapidly advances.</p>

<p>The following is Mr. Tulley’s scale of prices,
proportionate to the increase of aperture:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here, in the one case, the increase of half an
inch in the diameter of the object-glass, adds
about &pound;16. to the expense; and in the other case
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
no less than &pound;26. 5s. The proportion of light in
those two telescopes, compared with that of 2&frac34;
inches aperture, is as follows:&mdash;The square of the
2&frac34; object-glass is 7.56; that of 3&frac14;, 10.56, and that
of the 3&frac34;, 14.06; so that the light admitted by
the 3&frac14; compared with the 2&frac34; aperture, is nearly as
10 to 7; and the light admitted by the 3&frac34; object-glass
is nearly double that of the 2&frac34; aperture, and
will bear nearly a proportional increase of magnifying
power.</p>

<p>3. <i>The 5 feet Achromatic telescope.</i> The focal
length of the object-glass of this telescope is 5
feet 3 inches, and the diameter of its aperture
3<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches. The usual magnifying powers applied
to it are, for land objects 65 times; and for celestial
objects, 110, 190, 250, and sometimes one or
two higher powers. The quantity of light it
possesses is not much larger than that of the 3&frac12;
feet telescope, with 3&frac34; inches aperture; but the
larger focal length of this telescope is considered to
be an advantage; since the longer the focus of the
object-glass, the less will be its chromatic and
spherical aberrations, and the larger may be the
eye-glasses, and the flatter the field of view.</p>

<p>The above are all the kinds of achromatic
telescopes <i>generally</i> made by the London opticians.
Those of the larger kind, as 5 and 7 feet
telescopes, and the 3&frac12; feet with 3&frac34; inches aperture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
are generally made to order, and are not always to
be procured. But the 2&frac12; and 3&frac12; feet achromatics
of 2&frac34; inches aperture, are generally to be found
ready-made at most of the optician’s shops in
the metropolis. The prices of these instruments
are nearly the same in most of the optician’s shops
in London. Some of them demand a higher price,
but few of them are ever sold lower than what has
been stated above, unless in certain cases, where a
discount is allowed.</p>

<p>The stands for these telescopes, and the manner
in which they are fitted up for observation are represented
in figures 57, 58, and 59. Fig. 57 represents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
either the 2&frac12; or the 3&frac12; feet telescopes
mounted on a plain brass stand, to be placed on a
table. A is the long eye-piece for land objects,
and B the small eye-piece for astronomical observation,
which is composed of two lenses, and represents
the object in an inverted position.
These eye-pieces are screwed on, as occasion requires,
at E, the eye-end of the telescope. The
shorter of the two astronomical eye-tubes which
accompany this telescope, produces the highest
magnifying power. For adjusting the telescope
to distinct vision, there is a brass knob or button
at <i>a</i>, which moves a piece of rack-work connected
with the eye-tube, which must be turned either
one way or the other till the object appears distinctly;
and different eyes frequently require a
different adjustment.</p>

<p>Fig. 58, represents a 5 feet telescope fitted up
for astronomical observations. It is mounted on
a mahogany stand, the three legs of which are
made to close up together by means of the brass
frame <i>aaa</i>, which is composed of three bars, connected
with three joints in the centre, and three
other joints, connected with the three mahogany
bars. It is furnished with an apparatus for equatorial
motions. The brass pin is made to move
round in the brass socket <i>b</i>, and may be tightened
by means of the finger screw <i>d</i>, when the telescope
is directed nearly to the object intended to be
viewed. This socket may be set perpendicular to
the horizon, or to any other required angle; and
the quantity of the angle is ascertained by the
divided arc, and the instrument made fast in that
position by the screw <i>e</i>. If this socket be set to the
latitude of the place of observation, and the plane
of this arc be turned so as to be in the plane of
the meridian, the socket <i>b</i> being fixed to the inclination
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
of the pole of the earth, the telescope
when turned in this socket, will have an equatorial
motion, so that celestial objects may be always
kept in view, when this equatorial motion is performed.
The two handles at <i>k</i> are connected with
rack-work, intended to move the telescope in any
required direction. The two sets of brass sliding
rods <i>ii</i> are intended to render the telescope as
steady as possible, and to elevate and depress it at
pleasure, and are so constructed as to slide into
each other with the utmost ease.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 58.</i></p>
<img id="fig058" src="images/fig058.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The <i>Finder</i> is placed at AE, either on the top
or the left side of the tube of the telescope.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
When high magnifying powers are applied to any
telescope, it is sometimes difficult, on account of
the smallness of the field of view, to direct the
main tube of the telescope to the object. But
the Finder, which is a telescope with a small
power, and consequently has a large field of view&mdash;when
directed to any object, it is easily found,
and being brought to the centre of the field,
where two cross hairs intersect each other, it
will then be seen in the larger telescope. B is the
eye-tube for terrestrial objects, containing 4 glasses,
and C, one of the astronomical eye-pieces. A
socket is represented at <i>g</i>, containing a stained
glass, which is screwed to any of the eye-pieces,
to protect the eye from the glare of light, when
viewing the spots of the sun. The brass nut
above <i>f</i>, is intended for the adjustment of the eye-piece
to distinct vision. The 3&frac12; feet telescope is
sometimes mounted in this form.</p>

<p>Fig. 59, represents a 5 or 6 feet telescope,
mounted on a stand of a new construction by
Dollond. It possesses the advantage of supporting
the telescope in two places, which renders it
extremely steady&mdash;a property of great importance
when viewing celestial objects with high magnifying
powers. It possesses likewise, the advantage
of enabling the observer to continue seated at the
same height from the floor, although the telescope
be raised to any altitude&mdash;<i>the elevation being entirely
at the object end</i>, although it may be changed
from the horizon to the zenith. The frame-work
is composed of bars of mahogany, and rests on
three castors, two of which are made fast to their
respective legs in the usual way, and the third
stands under the middle of the lower horizontal
bar that connects the two opposite legs, so that
the frame has all the advantages of a tripod. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
it becomes very inconvenient to stoop to the eye
end of a telescope, when the altitude of an
object is considerable, and the centre of motion at
the middle of the tube, this construction of a
stand serves to remedy such inconvenience.</p>

<h4 id="PROPORTIONS_OF_CURVATURE_OF_THE_LENSES_WHICH_FORM"><i>Proportions of curvature of the lenses which form an achromatic object-glass.</i></h4>

<p>As some ingenious mechanics may feel a desire
to attempt the construction of a compound achromatic
object-glass, I shall here state some of the
proportions of curvature of the concave and convex
lenses, which serve to guide opticians in their
construction of achromatic instruments. These
proportions are various; and even when demonstrated
to be mathematically correct, it is sometimes
difficult to reduce them to practice, on
account of the different powers of refraction and
dispersion possessed by different discs of crown
and flint-glass, and of the difficulty of producing
by mechanical means, the exact curves which
theory requires. The following table shows the
radii of curvature of the different surfaces of the
lenses necessary to form <i>a double achromatic
object-glass</i>&mdash;it being supposed that the sine of
refraction in the crown-glass is as 1.528 to 1, and
in the flint as 1.5735 to 1; the ratio of their dispersive
powers being as 1 to 1.524. It is also
assumed that the curvatures of the concave lens
are as 1 to 2, that is, that the one side of this lens
is ground on a tool, the radius of which is double
that of the other. The 1st column expresses the
compound focus of the object-glass in <i>inches</i>; the
2nd column states the radius of the <i>anterior</i> surface
of the <i>crown</i>, and column 3rd, its <i>posterior</i> side.
Column 4th expresses the radius of the anterior
surface of the <i>concave</i> lens, and column 5th its
posterior surface, which, it will be observed, is
exactly double that of the other.

<p>From the above table it will be seen, that to
construct, for example, a 30 inch compound object-glass,
the radius of the anterior side of the crown
must be 7&frac12; inches, and that of the posterior side
11.63 inches; the radius of the anterior surface
of the concave 10.428, and that of the posterior
20.856 inches. It may be proper to observe, that
in these computations, the radius of the anterior
surface of the concave is less than the posterior
side of the convex, and consequently admits of
its approach, without touching in the centre&mdash;a
circumstance which always requires to be guarded
against in the combination of achromatic glasses.

the lenses of a <i>triple</i> object-glass, calculated from
formula deduced by Dr. Robison of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>From this table it appears, that the two convex
lenses, have the same radii of their respective
sides and that the concave flint lens has its two
surfaces equally concave, so that a triple object-glass
formed according to these proportions, would
require only three pair of grinding tools. The
following are the curves of the lenses of one of
the best of Dollond’s achromatic telescopes, the
focal length of the compound object-glass being
46 inches. Reckoning from the surface next the
object&mdash;the radii of the crown-glass were 28 and
40 inches: the concave lens 20.9 inches, and the
inner crown-glass lens, 28.4 and 28.4 inches.
This telescope carried magnifying powers of from
100 to 200 times.</p>

<p>Although I have inserted the above tables, which
might in some measure guide an ingenious artist,
yet on the whole, a private amateur has little
chance in succeeding in such attempts. The
diversity of glasses, and the uncertainty of an
unpractised workman’s producing the precise
curvatures he intends, is so great, that the object-glass,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
for the most part, turns out different from
his expectations. The great difficulty in the construction
is to find the exact proportion of the
dispersive powers of the crown and flint glass.
The crown is pretty constant, but there are
hardly two pots of flint glass which have the same
dispersive power. Even if constant, it is difficult
to measure it accurately; and an error in this
greatly affects the instrument; because the focal
distances of the lenses must be nearly as their
dispersive powers. In the two preceding tables,
the sine of incidence, in the crown glass, is supposed
to be to the sine of refraction as 1.526 to 1;
and in the flint glass, as 1.604 to 1. Opticians
who make great numbers of lenses both of flint
and crown glass, acquire, in time, a pretty good
guess of the nature of the errors which may
remain after they have finished an object-glass;
and having many lenses intended to be of the
same form, but unavoidably differing a little from
it, they try several of the concaves with the two
convexes, and finding one better than the rest,
they make use of it to complete the set. In this
way some of the best achromatic telescopes are
frequently formed. I have sometimes found,
when supplying a concave flint glass to a telescope
where it happened to be wanting, that, of four or
five concave lenses which appeared to be the same
as to curvature and other properties, only one
was found to produce a distinct and colourless
image. Should any one, however, wish to
attempt the construction of an achromatic lens,
the best way for preventing disappointments in
the result is, to procure a <i>variety</i> of tables of the
respective curvatures founded on <i>different conditions</i>,
and which, of course, require the surfaces
of the several lenses to be of different curves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Having lenses of different radii at his command,
and having glass of different refractive or dispersive
powers, when one combination does not exactly
suit, he may try another, and ultimately may succeed
in constructing a good achromatic telescope;
for, in many cases, it has been found that chance,
or a happy combination of lenses by trial, has led
to the formation of an excellent object-glass.</p>

<h4 id="ACHROMATIC_TELESCOPES_COMPOSED_OF_FLUID_LENSES"><i>Achromatic telescopes composed of fluid lenses.</i></h4>

<p>The best achromatic telescopes, when minutely
examined, are found to be in some respects defective,
on account of that slight degree of colour
which, by the aberration of the rays, they give to
objects, unless the object-glass be of small diameter.
When we examine with attention a good
achromatic telescope we find that it does not show
white or luminous objects perfectly free from
colour, their edges being tinged on one side with
a claret-coloured fringe, and on the other with a
green fringe. This telescope, therefore, required
farther improvement, to get rid of these secondary
colours, and Father Boscovich, to whom every
branch of optics is much indebted, displayed much
ingenuity in his attempts to attain this object.
But it is to Dr. Blair, professor of astronomy in
Edinburgh, that we are chiefly indebted for the
first successful experiments by which this end was
accomplished. By a judicious set of experiments,
he proved that the quality of dispersing the rays
in a greater degree than crown-glass, is not confined
to a few mediums; but is possessed by a
great variety of fluids, and by some of these in a
most extraordinary degree. Having observed
that when the extreme red and violet rays were
perfectly united, the green were left out, he conceived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
the idea of making an achromatic concave
lens which should refract the green less than the
united red and violet, and an achromatic convex lens
which should do the same, and as the concave lens
refracted the outstanding green <i>to</i> the axis, while
the concave one refracted them <i>from</i> the axis, it
followed, that, by a combination of these two
opposite effects, the green would be united with
the red and violet.</p>

<p>By means of an ingenious prismatic apparatus,
he examined the optical properties of a great
variety of fluids. The solutions of metals and semi-metals
proved in all cases more dispersive than
crown glass. Some of the salts, such as sal-ammoniac,
greatly increased the dispersive power
of water. The marine acid disperses very considerably,
and this quality increases with its
strength. The most dispersive fluids were accordingly
found to be those in which this acid and the
metals were combined. The chemical preparation
called <i>causticum antimoniale</i>, or butter of antimony,
in its most concentrated state, when it has just
attracted sufficient humidity to render it fluid,
possesses the quality of dispersing the rays in an
astonishing degree. The great quantity of the semi-metal
retained in solution, and the highly concentrated
state of the marine acid, are considered as
the cause of this striking effect. Corrosive sublimate
of mercury, added to a solution of <i>sal-ammoniacum</i>
in water, possesses the next place to
the butter of antimony among the dispersive fluids,
which Dr. Blair examined. The essential oils
were found to hold the next rank to metallic solutions,
among fluids which possess the dispersive
quality, particularly those obtained from bituminous
minerals, as native petrolea, pit coal, and
amber. The dispersive power of the essential oil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
of sassafras, and the essential oil of lemons, when
genuine, were found to be not much inferior to any
of these. But of all the fluids fitted for optical
purposes, Dr. Blair found that <i>the muriatic acid
mixed with a metallic solution</i>, or, in other words,
a fluid in which the marine acid and metalline
particles, hold a due proportion, most accurately
suited his purpose. In a spectrum formed by
this fluid the green were among the most refrangible
rays, and when its dispersion was corrected
by that of glass, there was produced
an inverted secondary
spectrum, that is, one in which
the green was above, when it
would have been below with a
common medium. He therefore
placed a concave lens of
muriatic acid with a metallic
solution between the two lenses,
as in fig. 60, where AB is the
concave fluid lens, CF a plano-convex
lens, with its plane
side next the object, and ED,
a meniscus. With this object-glass
the rays of different
colours were bent from their
rectilineal course with the same
equality and regularity as in
reflection.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img id="fig060" src="images/fig060.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Telescopes constructed with such object-glasses
were examined by the late Dr. Robison and professor
Playfair. The focal distance of the object-glass
of one of these did not exceed 17 inches,
and yet it bore an aperture of 3&frac12; inches. They
viewed some single and double stars and some
common objects with this telescope; and found,
that, in magnifying power, brightness, and distinctness,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
it was manifestly superior to one of Mr.
Dollond of 42 inches focal length. They had
most distinct vision of a star, <i>when using an erecting
eye-piece</i>, which made this telescope magnify
more than a 100 times; and they found the field
of vision as uniformly distinct as with Dollond’s
42 inch telescope magnifying 46 times; and were
led to admire the nice figuring and centering of
the very deep eye-glasses which were necessary
for this amplification. They saw double stars
with a degree of perfection which astonished them.
These telescopes, however, have never yet come
into general use; and one reason perhaps, is, that
they are much more apt to be deranged, than
telescopes constructed of object-glasses which are
solid. If any species of glass, or other solid
transparent substance could be found with the
same optical properties, instruments might perhaps
be constructed of a larger size, and considerably
superior to our best achromatic telescopes.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> It
is said that Mr. Blair, the son of Dr. Blair, some
years ago, was engaged in prosecuting his father’s
views, but I have not heard any thing respecting
the result of his investigations.</p>

<h4 id="BARLOWS_REFRACTING_TELESCOPE_WITH_A_FLUID_CONCAVE_LENS"><i>Barlow’s refracting telescope with a fluid concave lens.</i></h4>

<p>Professor Barlow, not many years ago, suggested
a new fluid telescope, which is deserving
of attention; and, about the year 1829 constructed
one of pretty large dimensions. The fluid he
employs for this purpose is the <i>sulphuret of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
<i>Carbon</i>, which he found to be a substance which
possessed every requisite he could desire. Its
index is nearly the same as that of the best flint
glass, with a dispersive power more than double.
It is perfectly colourless, beautifully transparent,
and although very expansible, possesses the same,
or very nearly the same optical properties under
all circumstances to which it is likely to be exposed
in astronomical observations&mdash;except
perhaps, direct observations on the solar disc,
which will probably be found inadmissible. Mr.
Barlow first constructed an object-glass with this
fluid of 3 inches aperture, with which he could
see the small star in Polaris with a power of 46,
and with the higher powers several stars which are
considered to require a good telescope, for example
70, ρ Ophinchi, 39 Bootis, the quadruple star
ε Lyr&aelig;, ζ Aquarii, α Herculis, &amp;c. He next
constructed a 6 inch object-glass. With this
instrument the small star in Polaris is so distinct
and brilliant, with a power of 143, that its transit
might be taken with the utmost certainty. As
the mode of constructing these telescopes is somewhat
novel, it may be expedient to enter somewhat
into detail.</p>

<p>In the usual construction of achromatic telescopes,
the two or three lenses composing the
object-glass are brought into immediate contact;
and in the fluid telescope of Dr. Blair, the construction
was the same, the fluid having been
enclosed in the object-glass itself. But in Mr.
Barlow’s telescope, the fluid correcting lens is
placed at a distance from the plate lens equal to
half its focal length; and it might be carried still
farther back, and yet possess dispersive power to
render the object-glass achromatic. By this
means the fluid lens&mdash;which is the most difficult
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
part of the construction&mdash;is reduced to one half or
to less than one half of the size of the plate lens;
consequently, to construct a telescope of 10 or
12 inches aperture involves no greater difficulty
in the manipulation, than in making a telescope
of the usual description of 5 or 6 inches
aperture, except in the simple plate lens itself;
and, hence, a telescope of this kind, of 10 or 12
feet length, will be equivalent in its focal power
to one of 16 or 20 feet. By this
means, the tube may be shortened
several feet and yet possess a focal
power more considerable than could
be conveniently given to it on the
usual principle of construction. This
will be better understood from the
annexed diagram. (fig. 61.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 61.</i></p>
<img id="fig061" src="images/fig061.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In this figure ABCD represent
the tube of the 6 inch telescope, CD,
the plate object-glass, F the first
focus of rays, <i>de</i> the fluid concave
lens, distant from the former 24
inches. The focal length MF being
48, and consequently, as 48 : 6 ::
24 : 3 inches, the diameter of the
fluid lens. The resulting compound
focus is 62.5 inches. It is obvious,
therefore, that the rays <i>df</i>, <i>ef</i>, arrive
at the focus under the same convergency,
and with the same light as if
they proceeded from a lens of 6
inches diameter, placed at a distance
beyond the object-glass CD (as GH,)
determined by producing those rays
till they meet the sides of the tube
in GH, namely at 62.5 inches beyond
the fluid lens. Hence, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
obvious, the rays will converge as they would do
from an object-glass GH of the usual kind with a
focus of 10 feet 5 inches. We have thus, therefore,
shortened the tube 38.5 inches, or have at
least the advantage of a focus 38.5 inches longer
than our tube; and the same principle may be
carried much farther, so as to reduce the usual
length of refracting telescopes nearly one half
without increasing the aberration in the first
glass beyond the least that can possibly belong to
a telescope of the usual kind of the whole length.
It should likewise be observed that the adjustment
for focus may be made either in the usual
way, or by a slight movement of the fluid lens, as
in the Gregorian Reflectors, by means of the small
speculum.</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow afterwards constructed another and
a larger telescope on the same principle, the clear
aperture of which is 7.8 inches. Its tube is 11
feet, which, together with the eye-piece, makes
the whole length 12 feet, but its effective focus is
on the principle stated above, 18 feet. It carries
a power of 700 on the closest double stars in
South’s and Herschel’s catalogue, and the stars
are, with that power, round and defined, although
the field is not then so bright as could be desired.
The telescope is mounted on a revolving stand,
which works with considerable accuracy as an
azimuth and altitude instrument. To give steadiness
to the stand it has been made substantial and
heavy; its weight by estimation being 400 pounds,
and that of the telescope 130 pounds, yet its
motions are so smooth, and the power so arranged,
that it may be managed by one person with the
greatest ease, the star being followed by a slight
touch, scarcely exceeding that of the keys of a
piano-forte. The focal length of the plate lens is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
78 inches, and of the fluid lens 59.8 inches&mdash;which
at the distance of 40 inches produce a
focal length of 104 inches, a total length of 12
feet, and an equivalent focus of 18 feet. The
curves of the parallel meniscus checks for containing
the fluid are&mdash;30 inches, and 144 inches,
the latter towards the eye. The curves for the
plate lens are 56.4 and 144. There is an interior
tube 5 inches diameter, and 3 feet 6 inches long,
which carries the cell in which the fluid is enclosed,
and an apparatus by which it may be
moved backwards and forwards, so that the proper
adjustment may be made for colour, in the first
instance, and afterwards the focus is obtained by
the usual rack-work motion. The following is
the mode by which the fluid was enclosed. After
the best position has been determined practically
for the checks forming the fluid lens, these, with
the ring between them ground and polished accurately
to the same curves, are applied together,
and taken into an artificial high temperature, exceeding
the greatest at which the telescope is ever
expected to be used. After remaining here with
the fluid some time, the space between the glasses
is completely filled, immediately closed, cooled
down by evaporation, and removed into a lower
temperature. By this means a sudden condensation
takes place, an external pressure is brought
on the checks, and a bubble formed inside, which
is of course filled with the vapour of the fluid;
the excess of the atmospheric pressure beyond
that of the vapour being afterwards always acting
externally to prevent contact. The extreme
edges are then sealed with the serum of human
blood, or by strong fish-glue, and some thin
pliable metal surface. By this process, Mr.
Barlow says, ‘I have every reason to believe the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
lens becomes as durable as any lens of solid glass.
At all events I have the satisfaction of stating,
that my first 3 inch telescope has now been completed
more than fifteen months, and that no
change whatever has taken place in its performance,
nor the least perceptible alteration either in
the quantity or the quality of the fluid.’</p>

<p>The following are some of the observations
which have been made with this telescope, and
the tests to which it has been subjected. The
very small star which accompanies the pole-star is
generally one of the first tests applied to telescopes.
This small point of light appeared brilliant
and distinct; it was best seen with a power
of 120, but was visible with a power of 700. The
small star in Aldebaran was very distinct with a
power of 120. The small star α Lyr&aelig; was distinctly
visible with the same power. The small
star called by Sir J. Herschel <i>Debilissima</i>, between
4 ε and 5 Lyr&aelig;, whose existence, he says, could
not be suspected in either the 5 or 7 feet equatorial,
and invisible also with the 7 and 10 feet
reflectors of six and 9 inches aperture, but seen
double with the 20 feet reflector, is seen very satisfactorily
double with this telescope. η Persei,
marked as double in South and Herschel’s catalogue,
at the distance of 28&acute;&acute;, with another small
star at the distance of 3&acute; 67&acute;&acute;, is seen distinctly
sixfold, four of the small stars being within a considerably
less distance than the remote one of η
marked in the catalogue. And, rejecting the
remote star, the principal, and the four other
stars, form a miniature representation of Jupiter
and his satellites, three of them being nearly in a
line on one side, and the other on the opposite.
<i>Castor</i>, is distinctly double with 120, and well
opened and stars perfectly round with 360 and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
700: γ Leonis and α Piscium are seen with the same
powers equally round and distinct. In ε Bootis,
the small star is well separated from the larger,
and its blue colour well marked with a power of
360. η Coron&aelig; Borealis is seen double with a
power of 360 and 700. 52 Orionis, ζ Orionis, and
others of the same class are also well defined
with the same powers. In regard to the planets
which happened to be visible&mdash;Venus appeared
beautifully white and well defined with a power
of 120, but showed some colour with 360. Saturn
with the 120 power, is a very brilliant object, the
double ring and belts being well and satisfactorily
defined, and with the 360 power, it is still very
fine. The moon also is remarkably beautiful, the
edges and the shadows being well marked, while
the quantity of light is such as to bring to view
every minute distinction of figure and shade.</p>

<p>The principal objections that may be made to
this construction of a telescope are such as these:&mdash;Can
the fluid be permanently secured? Will it
preserve its transparency and other optical properties?
Will it not act upon the surface of the
glass and partially destroy it? &amp;c. To such
enquiries Mr. Barlow replies, that experience is
the only test we have; our spirit levels, spirit
thermometers, &amp;c., show that some fluids at least
may be preserved for many years, without experiencing
any change, and without producing any in
the appearance of the glass tubes containing them.
But should any of these happen, except the last,
nothing can be more simple than to supply the
means of replacing the fluid at any time, and by
any person, without disturbing the adjustment of
the telescope. He expresses his hope that,
should these experiments be prosecuted, an achromatic
telescope may ultimately be produced which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
shall exceed in aperture and power, any instruments
of the kind hitherto attempted. If the
prejudice against the use of fluids could be removed,
he feels convinced that well-directed
practice would soon lead to the construction of
the most perfect instruments, on this principle, at
a comparatively small expense. ‘I am convinced,’
he says, ‘judging from what has been paid for
large object-glasses, that my telescope, telescope
stand, and the building for observation, with every
other requisite convenience, have been constructed
for a less sum than would be demanded for the
object-glass only, if one could be produced of the
same diameter of plate and flint-glass; and this is
a consideration which should have some weight,
and encourage a perseverance in the principle of
construction.’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<h4 id="ROGERS_ACHROMATIC_TELESCOPE_ON_A_NEW_PLAN">ROGERS’ ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE ON A NEW PLAN.</h4>

<p>The object of this construction is to render a
small disc of flint-glass available to perform the
office of compensation to a much larger one of
crown-glass, and thus to render possible the construction
of telescopes of much larger aperture
than are now common, without hindrance from
the difficulty at present experienced in procuring
large discs of flint-glass. It is well known to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
those who are acquainted with telescopes, that in
the construction of an ordinary achromatic object-glass,
in which a single crown lens is compensated
by a single one of flint, the two lenses admit of
being separated only by an interval too small to
afford any material advantage, <i>in diminishing the
diameter of the flint lens</i>, by placing it in a narrower
part of the cone of rays&mdash;the actual amount of
their difference in point of dispersive power being
such as to render the correction of the chromatic
aberration impossible, when their mutual distance
exceeds a certain limit. This inconvenience Mr.
Rogers proposes to obviate, by employing, as a
correcting lens&mdash;not a single lens of flint, but a
compound one consisting of a convex crown and
concave flint, whose foci are such as to cause their
combination to act as a plain glass on the mean
refrangible rays. Then it is evident, that by
means of the greater dispersive power of flint
than of crown glass, this will act as a concave on
the violet, and as a convex on the red rays, and
<i>that</i> the more powerfully, according as the lenses
separately have greater powers or curvature. If
then, such a compound lens be interposed between
the object-glass of a telescope&mdash;supposed to be a
single lens of plate or crown-glass&mdash;and its focus,
it will cause no alteration in the focus for mean
rays, while it will lengthen the focus for violet,
and shorten it for red rays. Now this is precisely
what is wanted to produce an achromatic union of
all the rays in the focus; and as nothing in this
construction limits the powers of the individual
correcting lenses, they may therefore be applied
any where that convenience may dictate; and
thus, theoretically speaking, a disc of flint-glass,
however small, may be made to correct the colour
of one of crown however large.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>This construction, likewise, possesses other and
very remarkable advantages. For, first, when
the correcting lens is approximately constructed
on a calculation founded on its intended aperture,
and on the refractive and dispersive indices of its
materials, the final and complete dispersion of
colour may be effected, not by altering the lenses
by grinding them anew, but by shifting the combination
nearer to, or farther from, the object-glass,
as occasion may require, along the tube of
a telescope, by a screw motion, till the condition
of achromaticity is satisfied in the best manner
possible. And secondly, the spherical aberration
may in like manner be finally corrected, by
slightly separating the lenses of the correcting
glass, whose surfaces should for this purpose be
figured to curvatures previously determined by
calculation, to admit of this mode of correction&mdash;a
condition which Mr. Rogers finds to be always
possible. The following is the rule he lays down
for the determination of the foci of the lenses of
the correcting glass:&mdash;‘The focal length of either
lens of the correcting lens is to that of the object-glass,
in a ratio compounded of the ratio of the
square of the aperture of the correcting lens to
that of the object-glass, and of the ratio of the
difference of the dispersive indices of the crown
and flint glass, to the dispersive index of crown.’
For example, to correct the colour of a lens of
crown or plate glass of 9 inches aperture, and 14
feet focal length (the dimensions of the telescope
of Fraunhofer at Dorpat) by a disc of flint glass 3
inches in diameter, the focus of either lens of the
correcting lens will require to be about 9 inches.
To correct it by a 4 inch disc will require a focus
of about 16 inches each.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers remarks, that it is not indispensable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
to make the correcting glass act as a plane lens.
It is sufficient if it be so adjusted as to have a
shorter focus for red rays than for violet. If, preserving
this condition, it be made to act as a concave
lens, the advantage procured by Mr. Barlow’s
construction of reducing the length of the telescope
with the same focal power, is secured, and
he considers, moreover, that by a proper adaptation
of the distances, foci, &amp;c., of the lenses, we
might hope to combine with all these advantages
that of the destruction of the secondary spectrum,
and thus obtain a perfect telescope.</p>

<p>The above is an abstract of a paper read to the
‘Astronomical Society of London’ in April 1828,
by A. Rogers, Esq.</p>

<p>The reader will easily perceive that the principle
on which Mr. Rogers proposes to construct
his telescope is very nearly similar to that of professor
Barlow, described above, with this difference,
that the correcting lens of the Professor’s telescope
is composed of a transparent <i>fluid</i>, while that of
Mr. Rogers is a <i>solid</i> lens consisting of a convex
crown and concave flint. The general object
intended to be accomplished by both is the same,
namely, to make a correcting lens of a comparatively
small diameter serve the purpose of a large
disc of flint glass, which has hitherto been very
expensive, and very difficult to be procured; and
likewise to reduce the length of the telescope
while the advantage of a long focal power is
secured.&mdash;A telescope, on this principle, was constructed
7 or 8 years ago by Mr. Wilson, lecturer
on Philosophy and Chemistry, Glasgow, before he
was aware that Mr. Rogers had proposed a similar
plan. I have had an opportunity of particularly
inspecting Mr. Wilson’s telescope, and trying its
effects on terrestrial objects with high powers, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
was on the whole highly pleased with its performance.
It appeared to be almost perfectly achromatic,
and produced a distinct and <i>well-defined</i>
image of minute distant objects, such as small
letters on sign-posts, at 2, 3 and 4 miles distant.
But I had no opportunity of trying its effects on
double stars or any other celestial objects. The
instrument is above 6 feet long; the object lens
is a plano-convex of crown glass 4 feet focal distance,
and 4 inches diameter, the plain side next
the object.</p>

<p>At 26 inches distant from the object lens is the
compound lens of 2 inches in diameter; and the
two lenses of which it is composed are both ground
to a radius of 3&frac34; inches. That made of crown
glass is <i>plano-convex</i>, the other, made of flint
glass, is plano-concave, and are placed close together,
the convex side being next the object, and
the concave side next the eye. The greater
refractive power of the flint glass renders the compound
one slightly concave in its effect (although
the radius of curvature is similar in both), and
lengthens the focus to 6 feet from the object-glass;
and this is consequently the length of the instrument.
The compound corrector so placed intercepts
all those rays which go to form the image in
the field of view, producing there an achromatic
image. The concave power of the corrector
renders the image larger than if directly produced
by a convex lens of the same focus. The concavity
of the corrector is valuable also in this respect,
that a very slight alteration in its distance from
the object-glass, changes the focal distance much
more than if it were plain, and enables us to
adjust the instrument to perfect achromatism with
great precision.

<p class="hang" id="HISTORY_OF_THE_INVENTION">SECT. 1.&mdash;HISTORY OF THE INVENTION, AND A
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.</p>

<p>Reflecting telescopes are those which represent
the images of distant objects by reflection, chiefly
from concave mirrors.</p>

<p>Before the achromatic telescope was invented,
there were two glaring imperfections in refracting
telescopes, which the astronomers of the 17th
century were anxious to correct. The first was
its very great length when a high power was to
be applied, which rendered it very unwieldy and
difficult to use. The second imperfection was the
incorrectness of the image as formed by a single
lens. Mathematicians had demonstrated that a
pencil of rays could not be collected in a single
point by a spherical lens, and also that the image
transmitted by such a lens would be in some
degree incurvated. After several attempts had
been made to correct this imperfection by grinding
lenses to the figure of one of the conic sections,
Sir I. Newton happened to commence an examination
of the colours formed by a prism; and having,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
by the means of this simple instrument, discovered
the different refrangibility of the rays of light&mdash;to
which we have several times adverted in the preceding
descriptions&mdash;he then perceived that the
errors of telescopes, arising from that cause alone,
were some hundred times greater than such as
were occasioned by the spherical figure of lenses;
which induced this illustrious philosopher to turn
his attention to the improvement of telescopes by
reflection.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that Mr. James
Gregory&mdash;a son of the Rev. John Gregory,
minister of Drumoak in the county of Aberdeen&mdash;was
the first who suggested the construction of a
reflecting telescope. He was a young man of
uncommon genius, and an eminent mathematician;
and in the year 1663, at the age of only
24, he published in London, his treatise entitled
‘Optica Promota,’ in which he explained the
theory of that species of reflecting telescope which
still bears his name, and which he stated as being
his own invention. But as Gregory, according to
his own account, was endowed with no mechanical
dexterity, and could find no workman capable of
realizing his invention&mdash;after some fruitless
attempts to form proper specula, he was obliged
to give up the pursuit; so that this telescope
remained for a considerable time neglected. It
was several years after Gregory suggested the
construction of reflecting telescopes, till Newton
directed his attention fully to the subject. In a
letter addressed to the secretary of the Royal
Society, dated in February, 1672, he says, ‘Finding
reflections to be regular, so that the angle of
reflection of all sorts of rays was equal to the
angle of incidence, I understood that, by their
mediation, optic instruments might be brought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
any degree of perfection imaginable, providing a
reflecting substance could be found which would
polish as finely as glass, and reflect as much light
as glass transmits, and the art of communicating
to it a parabolic figure be also obtained. Amidst
these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by
the intervening plague, and it was more than
two years before I proceeded further.’</p>

<p>It was towards the end of 1668, or in the
beginning of the following year, when Newton,
being obliged to have recourse to reflectors, and
not relying on any artificer for making the specula,
set about the work himself, and early in the year
1672, completed two small reflecting telescopes.
In these he ground the great speculum into a
spherical concave, although he approved of the
parabolic form, but found himself unable to
accomplish it. These telescopes were of a construction
somewhat different from what Gregory
had suggested, and though only 6 inches long,
were considered as equal to a 6 feet common
refracting telescope. It is not a little singular,
however, that we hear no more about the construction
of reflectors till more than half a century
afterwards. It was not till the year 1723, that
any reflectors were known to have been made,
adapted to celestial observations. In that year,
Mr. Hadley, the inventor of the reflecting quadrant,
which goes by his name, published in No.
376 of the Philosophical Transactions, an account
of a large reflector on Newton’s plan, which he
had just then constructed, the performance of
which left no room to doubt that this invention
would remain any longer in obscurity. The large
speculum of this instrument was 62⅝ inches focal
distance and 5 inches diameter, was furnished
with magnifying powers of from 190 to 230 times,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
and equalled in performance the famous aerial
telescope of Huygens of 123 feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
Since this period, the reflecting telescope has been
in general use among astronomers in most
countries of Europe, and has received numerous
improvements, under the direction of Short,
Mudge, Edwards and Herschel&mdash;the last of whom
constructed reflectors of 7, 10, 20, and even 40
feet in focal length, which far surpassed, in brightness
and magnifying power, all the instruments of
this description, which had previously been
attempted.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to give a brief sketch of
the nature of a reflecting telescope, and the different
forms in which they have been proposed to be
constructed.</p>

<p>Fig. 62 represents the reflecting telescope as
originally proposed by Gregory. ABEF represents
a tube open at AF towards the object; at
the other end is placed a concave speculum BE,
with a hole CD in its centre, the focus of which
is at <i>e</i>. A little beyond this focus, towards the
object end of the telescope AF, is placed another
small concave mirror G, having its polished face
turned towards the great speculum, and is supported
by an arm GH fastened to a slider connected
with the tube. At the end of the great
tube BE is screwed in a small tube CDKI, containing
a small plano-convex lens IK. Such are
the essential parts of this instrument and their
relative positions. It will be recollected in our
description of the properties of concave mirrors
(see page 92), that, when rays proceed from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
distant object, and fall upon a concave-speculum,
they paint an image or representation of the object
in its focus before the speculum. Now suppose
two parallel rays <i>ab</i> falling on the speculum BE,
in <i>cd</i>; they are reflected to its focus <i>e</i> where an
inverted image of the object is formed. This
image is formed at a little more than the focal
distance of the small speculum from its surface,
and serves as it were for an object on which the
small mirror may act. By the action of this
mirror this first image is reflected to a point about
<i>f</i>, where a second image is formed very large and
erect. This image is magnified in the proportion
of <i>f</i>G to <i>e</i>G, the rays from which are transmitted
to the eye glass IK, through which the eye perceives
the object clear and distinct, after the proper
adjustments have been made.</p>

<p>Suppose the focal distance of the great mirror
was 9 inches, and the focal distance of the small
mirror 1&frac12; inch&mdash;were we to remove the eye piece
of this telescope, and look through the hole of the
great mirror, we should see the image of the
object depicted upon the face of the small speculum,
and magnified, in the proportion of 9 to 1&frac12;,
or, 6 times, on the same principle as a common
convex object glass 9 inches focal length, with an
eye glass whose focus is 1&frac12; inch magnifies 6 times.
This may be regarded as the first part of the
magnifying power. If now, we suppose the small
speculum placed a little more than 1&frac12; inch from
the image formed by the great speculum, a second
image is formed about <i>f</i>, as much exceeding the
first in its dimensions as it exceeds it in distance
from the small speculum, on the principle on
which the object glass of a compound microscope
forms a large image near the eye glass. Suppose
this distance to be 9 times greater, then the whole
magnifying power will be compounded of 6 multiplied
by 9, or 54 times. As a telescope it magnifies
6 times, and in the microscope part 9 times.&mdash;Such
is a <i>general</i> idea of the Gregorian telescope,
the minute particulars and structure of which can
only be clearly perceived by a direct inspection of
the instrument.</p>

<p><i>The Newtonian Reflector.</i>&mdash;This instrument is
somewhat different both in its form and in its mode
of operation from that of Gregory. It is represented
in fig. 63, where BAEF is the tube, and
BE, the object concave mirror, which reflects the
parallel rays <i>ab</i> to a <i>plane</i> speculum G, placed 45&deg;,
or half a right angle to the axis of the concave
speculum. This small plane reflector must be of
an oval form, the length of the oval should be to
the breadth as 7 to 5, on account of the obliquity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of its position. It is supported on an arm fixed
to the side of the tube; an eye-glass is placed in
a small tube, moveable in the larger tube, so as to
be perpendicular to the axis of the large reflector,
the perpendicular line passing through the centre
of the small mirror. The small mirror is situated
between the large mirror and its focus, that its
distance from this focal point may be equal to the
distance from the centre of the mirror to the
focus of the eye-glass. When the rays <i>ab</i> from a
distant object fall upon the large speculum at <i>cd</i>,
they are reflected towards a focus at <i>h</i>; but being
intercepted by the plane mirror G, they are reflected
perpendicularly to the eye-glass at I, in the
side of the tube, and the image formed near that
position at <i>e</i> is viewed through a small plano-convex
lens. The magnifying power of this telescope
is in the proportion of the focal distance of
the speculum to that of the eye-glass. Thus, if
the focal distance of the speculum be 36 inches,
and that of the eye-glass <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of an inch, the magnifying
power will be 108 times. It was this form
of the reflecting telescope, that Newton invented,
which Sir. W. Herschel adopted, and with which
he made most of his observations and discoveries.</p>

<p><i>The Cassegrainian Reflector.</i>&mdash;This mode of
the reflecting telescope, suggested by M. Cassegrain,
a Frenchman, is represented in fig. 64. It
is constructed in the same way as the Gregorian,
with the exception of a small <i>convex</i> speculum G
being substituted in the room of the small concave
in Gregory’s construction. As the focus of a
convex mirror is negative, it is placed at a distance
from the large speculum equal to the difference
of their foci, that is, if the focal length of
the large speculum be 18 inches, and that of the
small convex 2 inches, they are placed at 16
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
inches distant from each other, on a principle
similar to that of the Galilean telescope, in which
the concave eye-glass is placed within the focus of
the object-glass by a space equal to the focal
length of the eye-glass. In this telescope, likewise,
instead of two there is only <i>one image</i>
formed, namely that in the focus of the eye-glass;
and, on this account some are of opinion that the
distinctness is considerably greater than in the
Gregorian. Mr. Ramsden was of opinion that
this construction is preferable to either of the
former reflectors, because the aberrations of the
two metals have a tendency to correct each other,
whereas in the Gregorian both the metals being
concave, any error in the specula will be doubled.
It is his opinion that the aberrations in the Cassegrainian
construction to that of the Gregorian is
as 3 to 5. The length of this telescope is shorter
than that of a Gregorian of equal focal length, by
twice the focal length of the small mirror, and it
shows every thing in an <i>inverted</i> position, and
consequently is not adapted for viewing terrestrial
objects.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Hook’s Reflector.</i>&mdash;Before the reflecting
telescope was much known, Dr. Hook contrived
one, the form of which is represented, fig. 65,
which differs in little or nothing from the Gregorian,
except that the eye-glass I is placed in the
hole of the great speculum BE.</p>

<p><i>Martin’s Reflector.</i>&mdash;Mr. Bengamin Martin, a
distinguished writer on optical and philosophical
science, about a century ago, described a new
form of the reflecting telescope, approximating to
the Newtonian structure, which he contrived for
his own use. It is represented in fig. 66. ABEF
is the tube, in which there is an opening or aperture
OP, in the upper part. Against this hole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
within the tube is placed a large plane speculum
GH, at half a right angle with the axis or sides
of the tubes, with a hole CD perforated through
its middle. The parallel rays <i>a b</i> falling on the
inclined plane GH are reflected perpendicularly
and parallel on the great speculum BE in the
bottom of the tube. From thence they are reflected
converging to a focus <i>e</i> through the hole
of the plane mirror CD, which being also the
focus of the eye-glass IK, the eye will perceive
the object magnified and distinct.</p>

<p>In the figures referred to in the above descriptions,
only one eye-glass is represented to avoid
complexity; but in most reflecting telescopes, the
eye-piece consists of a combination of two plano-convex
glasses, as in fig. 67, which produces a
more correct and a larger field of view than a
single lens. This combination is generally known
by the name of the <i>Huygenian eye-piece</i> which
shall be described in the section on the <i>eye-pieces</i>
of telescopes.</p>

<p>The following rule has been given for finding
the magnifying power of the Gregorian telescope:&mdash;Multiply
the focal distance of the great mirror
by the distance of the small mirror from the image
next the eye; and multiply the focal distance of
the small mirror by the focal distance of the eye-glass;
then divide the product of the former multiplication
by the product of the latter, and the
quotient will express the magnifying power. The
following are the dimensions of one of the reflecting
telescopes constructed by Mr. Short&mdash;who
was long distinguished as the most eminent maker
of such instruments, on a large scale, and whose
large reflectors are still to be found in various observatories
throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The focal distance of the great mirror 9.6
inches; or P <i>m</i>, fig. 67, its breadth FD 2.3; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
focal distance of the small mirror L <i>n</i> 1.5&mdash;or 1&frac12;
inch&mdash;its breadth <i>g h</i> 0.6&mdash;or <sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of an inch; the
breadth of the hole in the great mirror UV, 0.5&mdash;or
half an inch&mdash;the distance between the small
mirror and the next eye-glass LR, 14.2; the distance
between the two eye-glasses SR, 2.4; the
focal distance of the eye-glass next the metal, 3.8.;
and the focal distance of the eye-glass next the
eye, S <i>a</i> 1.1, or one inch and one tenth. The magnifying
power of this telescope was about 60 times.
Taking this telescope as a standard, the following
table of the dimensions and magnifying powers of
Gregorian reflecting telescopes, as constructed by
Mr. Short, has been computed.</p>

<p>Mr. Short&mdash;who was born in Edinburgh in
1710, and died near London, 1768&mdash;was considered
as the most accurate constructor of reflecting
telescopes, during the period which intervened
from 1732, to 1768. In 1743, he constructed a
reflector for Lord Thomas Spencer, of 12 feet
focal length, for which he received 600 guineas.
He made several other telescopes of the same
focal distance, with greater improvements and
higher magnifiers; and in 1752, finished one for
the king of Spain, for which, with its whole apparatus,
he received &pound;1200. This was considered
the noblest instrument of its kind that had then
been constructed, and perhaps it was never surpassed,
till Herschel constructed his twenty and
forty feet reflectors. High as the prices of large
telescopes now are, Mr. Short charged for his instruments
at a much higher rate than opticians
now do, although the price of labour, and every
other article required in the construction of a
telescope, is now much dearer. But he had then
scarcely any competitor, and he spared neither
trouble nor expense to make his telescopes perfect,
and put such a price upon them as properly
repaid him. The following table contains a statement
of the apertures, powers, and prices of
Gregorian telescopes, as constructed by Mr. James
Short.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>

<p>From this table, it appears that Mr. Short
charged 75 guineas for a 3 feet reflector, whereas
such an instrument is now marked in the London
opticians’ catalogues at &pound;23, when mounted on a
common brass stand, and &pound;39. 18s., when accompanied
with rack-work motions and other apparatus.
It is now generally understood that in the
above table, Short always greatly <i>overrated</i> the
higher powers of his telescopes. By experiment
they were generally found to magnify <i>much less</i>
than here expressed.</p>

<p><i>General remarks on Gregorian Reflectors.</i>&mdash;1.
In regard to the hole UV, of the great speculum&mdash;its
diameter should be equal, or nearly so, to
that of the small speculum L, fig. 67. For if it
be less, no more parallel rays will be reflected
than if it were equal to <i>g h</i>, and it may do harm
in contracting the visible area within too narrow
limits. Nor must it be larger than the mirror L,
because some parallel rays will then be lost, and
those of most consequence as being nearest the
centre. 2. The small hole at <i>e</i> to which the eye is
applied, must be nicely adjusted to the size of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
cone of rays proceeding from the nearest lens S. If
it be larger, it will permit the foreign light of the
sky or other objects to enter the eye, so as to prevent
distinct vision; for the eye should receive
no light, but what comes from the surface of the
small mirror L. If the hole be smaller than the
cylinder of rays at <i>e</i> then some of the necessary
light will be excluded, and the object rendered
more obscure. The diameter of this hole may
be found by dividing the aperture of the telescope
in inches by its magnifying power. Thus, if we
divide the diameter of one of Short’s telescopes,
the diameter of whose large speculum is 2.30, by
60, the magnifying power, the quotient will be
.0383, which is nearly the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub> of an inch. Sometimes
this hole is made so small as the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub> of an
inch. When this hole is, by any derangement,
shifted from its proper position, it sometimes requires
great nicety to adjust it, and, before it is
accurately adjusted, the telescope is unfit for accurate
observation. 3. It is usual to fix a plate
with a hole in it, at <i>a b</i>, the focus of the eye glass
S, of such a diameter as will circumscribe the
image, so as to exhibit only that part of it which
appears distinct, and to exclude the superfluous
rays. 4. There is an adjusting screw on the outside
of the great tube, connected with the small
speculum, by which that speculum may be pushed
backwards or forwards to adjust the instrument to
distinct vision. The hand is applied for this purpose
at T.</p>

<p><i>Newtonian Telescopes.</i>&mdash;These telescopes are
now more frequently used for celestial observations
than during the last century, when Gregorian
reflectors were generally preferred. Sir W. Herschel
was chiefly instrumental in introducing this
form of the reflecting telescope to the more particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
attention of astronomers, by the splendour
and extent of the discoveries which it enabled
him to make. In this telescope there is no hole
required in the middle of the great speculum, as
in the Gregorian construction, which circumstance
secures the use of all the rays which flow from
the central parts of the mirror.</p>

<p>The following table contains a statement of the
apertures and magnifying powers of Newtonian
Telescopes, and the focal distances of their eye-glasses.
The first column contains the focal length
of the great speculum in feet; the second, its
linear aperture in inches; the third, the focal distance
of the single glass in decimals, or in 1000ths
of an inch, and the fourth column, contains the
magnifying power. This portion of the table was
constructed by using the dimensions of Mr. Hadley’s
Newtonian Telescope, formerly referred to, as
a standard&mdash;the focal distance of the great mirror
being 62&frac12; inches, its medium aperture 5 inches,
and power 208. The fifth, sixth, and seventh
columns contains the apertures of the concave
speculum, the focal lengths of the eye-glasses and
the magnifying powers, as calculated by Sir D.
Brewster, from a telescope of Mr. Hauksbee,
taken as a standard; whose focal length was 3
feet 3 inches, its aperture about 4 inches, and
magnifying power 226 times.

<p>One great advantage of reflecting telescopes
above common refractors, is, that they will admit
of eye glasses of a much shorter focal distance,
and consequently, will magnify so much the more,
for the rays are not coloured by reflection from a
concave mirror, if it be ground to a true figure,
as they are by passing through a convex glass
though figured and polished with the utmost
exactness. It will be perceived from the above
table, that the focal length of the eye glasses is
very small, the lowest there stated being only
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of an inch, and the highest little more
than &frac14; of an inch focal distance. Sir W. Herschel
obtained the high powers which he sometimes put
upon his telescopes, by using small double convex
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
lenses for eye glasses, some of which did not exceed
the <i>one fiftieth of an inch</i> in focal length.
When the focal length of the concave speculum,
and that of the eye glass are given, the magnifying
power is found by dividing the former by the
latter, after having reduced the focal length of the
concave speculum to inches. Thus the 6 feet
speculum, multiplied by 12, produces 72 inches,
which, divided by Brewster’s number for the
focus of the eye glass = 200, or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> of an inch, produces
a quotient of 360 as the magnifying power.
It has been calculated that, if the metals of a
Newtonian telescope be worked as exquisitely as
those in Sir W. Herschel’s 7 feet reflector, the
highest power that such a telescope should bear
with perfect distinctness, will be found by multiplying
the diameter of the great speculum in
inches, by 74, and the focal distance of the single
eye glass may be found by dividing the focal distance
of the great mirror by the magnifying power.
Thus 6.25&mdash;the aperture in inches of Herschel’s
7 feet Newtonian&mdash;multiplied by 74 is 462&frac12;, the
magnifying power; and 7 multiplied by 12, and
divided by 462.5 is 0.182 of an inch, the focal
distance of the single eye glass required. But it
is seldom that more than one half of this power
can be applied with effect to any of the planetary
bodies. For general purposes the power produced
by multiplying the diameter of the speculum
by 30, or 40, will be found most satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Comparative brightness of achromatic and reflecting
telescopes.</i> The late astronomer royal,
Dr. Maskelyne, from a comparison of a variety of
telescopes, was led to the following conclusion,&mdash;‘that
the aperture of a common reflecting telescope,
in order to show objects as bright as the
achromatic must be to that of an achromatic
telescope as 8 to 5,’&mdash;in other words, an achromatic
whose object glass is 5 inches diameter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
will show objects with as great a degree of brightness
as a reflector whose large speculum is 8 inches
in diameter. This result, if correct, must be
owing to the small number of rays reflected from
a speculum compared with the number transmitted
through an achromatic object glass.</p>

<h4 id="THE_HERSCHELIAN_TELESCOPE">SECT. 2.&mdash;THE HERSCHELIAN TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>Soon after Sir William Herschel commenced his
astronomical career, he introduced a new era in
the history of reflecting telescopes. After he had
cast and polished an immense variety of specula
for telescopes of different sizes-he, at length, in
the year 1782, finished a 20 feet reflector with a
large aperture. Being sensible of the vast quantity
of light which is lost by a second reflection from
the small speculum, he determined to throw it
aside altogether, and mounted this 20 feet reflector
on a stand that admitted of being used without
a small speculum in making <i>front observations</i>&mdash;that
is, in sitting with his back to the object, and
looking directly towards the surface of the speculum.
Many of his discoveries and measurements
of double stars were made with this instrument,
till, at length, in the year 1785 he put the finishing
hand to that gigantic speculum, which soon became
the object of universal astonishment, and
which was intended for his <i>forty feet</i> reflecting
telescope; he had succeeded so well in constructing
reflecting telescopes of comparatively small
aperture, that they would bear higher magnifying
powers than had ever previously been applied;
but he found that a deficiency of light could only
be remedied by an increased diameter of the
large speculum, which therefore was his main
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
object, when he undertook to accomplish a work
which to a man less enterprising, would have
appeared impracticable. The difficulties he had
to overcome were numerous; particularly in the
operative department of preparing, melting,
annealing, grinding, and polishing a mass of
metal that was too unwieldly to be moved without
the aid of mechanical powers. At length, however,
all difficulties having been overcome, this
magnificent instrument was completed with all its
complicated apparatus, and erected for observation,
on the 28th of August, 1789, and on the
same day the sixth satellite of Saturn was detected,
as a prelude of still farther discoveries which were
afterwards made by this instrument, in the celestial
regions.</p>

<p>It would be too tedious to attempt a description
of all the machinery and apparatus connected with
this noble instrument. The reader who wishes to
peruse a minute description of the stairs, ladders,
platform, rollers, and of every circumstance relating
to joiner’s work, carpenter’s work, smith’s work,
and other particulars connected with the formation
and erection of this telescope, will find the details
recorded in the 85th volume of the Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society of London, for
1795, in which there are sixty-three pages of
letter press, and eighteen plates illustrative of the
subject. I shall content myself with giving a
short outline of the essential parts belonging to
this instrument.</p>

<p>The <i>tube</i> of this telescope is made of rolled or
sheet iron, joined together without rivets; the
thickness of the sheets is somewhat less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>36</sub>
part of an inch, or 14 pounds weight for a square
foot; great care was taken that the cylindrical
form should be secured, and the whole was coated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
over three or four times with paint, inside and
outside, to secure it against the damp. This tube
was removed from the place in which it was formed
by twenty-four men, divided into six sets; so that
two men on each side, with a pole of 5 feet long
in their hands, to which was affixed a piece of
course cloth, 7 feet long going under the tube,
and joined to a pole 5 feet long, in the hands of
two other men, assisted in carrying the tube. The
<i>length</i> of this tube is 39 feet 4 inches, the diameter
4 feet 10 inches; and, on a moderate computation,
it was ascertained, that a wooden tube of
proper dimensions would have exceeded an iron
one in weight by at least 3000 pounds. Reckoning
the circumference of the tube 15 feet, its
length 39⅓ feet, and 14 lib. for the weight of a
square foot, it must have contained 590 square
feet, and weighed 8,260 pounds. Various hoops
were fixed within the tube, and longitudinal bars
of iron connecting some of them are attached to
the two ends of the tube, by way of bracing the
sheets, and preserving the shape perfect, when the
pulleys are applied to give the necessary elevation
at the upper end, and that the speculum may be
kept secure at the lower end. The lower end of
the tube is firmly supported on rollers that are
capable of being moved forwards or backwards by
a double rack, connected with a set of wheels and
pinions. By an adjustment at the lower extremity
of the tube, the speculum is turned to a
small inclination, so that the line of collimation
may not be coincident with the longitudinal axis
of the tube, but may cross the tube diagonally,
and meet the eye in the air at about two inches
from the edge of the tube, which is the peculiarity
of the construction, that supersedes the necessity
of applying a second reflector. Hence no part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
of the head of the observer intercepts the incident
rays, and the observation is taken with the face
looking at the speculum, the back being turned
to the object to be observed.</p>

<p>The large speculum is enclosed in a strong iron
ring, braced across with bars of iron, and an
enclosure of iron and ten sheets makes a case for
it. It is lifted by three handles of iron attached
to the sides of the ring, and is put into and taken
out of its proper place in the tube by the help
of a moveable crane, running on a carriage, which
operation requires great care. The speculum is
made of a metallic composition, and is 49&frac12; inches
in diameter; but the concave polished surface is
only 48 inches, or 4 feet in diameter. Its thickness
is 31 inches; and when it came from the cast
its weight was 2118 pounds. The metals for its
formation were procured at a warehouse in
Thames Street, London, where they kept ingots
of two kinds ready made, one of white, and the
other of bell-metal; and it was composed of two
ingots of bell-metal for one of white. It was not
to be expected that a speculum of such large
dimensions, could have a perfect figure imparted
to its surface, nor that the curve, whatever it
might be, would remain identically the same in
changes of temperature; therefore we are not
surprised when we are told, that the magnifying
powers used with this telescope seldom exceeded
200; the quantity of light collected by so large a
surface being the principal aim of the maker.
The raising of the balcony, on which the observer
stands, and the sliding of the lower end of the
tube, in which the speculum rests, are effected by
separate tackles, and require only occasional motions;
but the elevation of the telescope requires
the main tackle to be employed, and the motion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
usually given in altitude at once was two degrees;
the breadth of the zone in which the observations
were made, as the motion of the sphere in right
ascension brought the objects into view. A star,
however, could be followed for about a quarter of
an hour. Three persons were employed in using
this telescope, one to work the tackle, another
to observe, and a third to mark down the observations.
The elevation was pointed out by a small
quadrant fixed to the main tube, near the lower
end, but the polar distance was indicated by a
piece of machinery, worked by a string, which
continually indicated the degree and minute on
a dial in the small house adjoining, while the
time was shown by a clock in the same place,
Miss Herschel performing the office of Registrar.</p>

<p>At the upper end the tube is open, and directed
to the part of the heavens intended for observation,
and the observer, standing on the foot board,
looks down the tube, and perceives the object by
rays reflected from the speculum, through the eye
glass at the opening of the tube. When the
telescope is directed to any objects near the zenith,
the observer is necessarily at an elevation at least
40 feet from the ground. Near the place of the
eye glass is the end of a tin pipe, into which a
mouth-piece may be placed, so that, during an
observation, a person may direct his voice into this
pipe, while his eye is at the glass. This pipe,
which is 1&frac12; inch in diameter runs down to the
bottom of the tube, where it goes into a turning
joint, thence into a drawing tube, and out of this
into another turning joint, from whence it proceeds,
by a set of sliding tubes towards the front of the
foundation timber. Its use is to convey the voice
of the observer to his assistants, for at the last
place, it divides itself into two branches, one going
into the observatory, the other into the workman’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
room, ascending in both places through the floor,
and terminates in the usual shape of speaking
trumpets. Though the voice passes in this manner
through a tube, with many inflections, and through
not less than 115 feet, it requires very little exertion
to be well understood.</p>

<p>To direct so unwieldy a body to any part of the
heavens at pleasure, many mechanical contrivances
were evidently necessary. The whole apparatus
rests upon rollers, and care was previously taken
of the foundation in the ground. This consists
of concentrical brick walls, the outermost 42
feet, the innermost 21 feet in diameter, 2 feet
6 inches deep under ground, 2 feet 3 inches broad
at the bottom, and 1 foot 2 inches at the top,
capped with paving stones 3 inches thick, and
12&frac34; inches broad.</p>

<p>In the centre is a large post of oak, framed
together with braces under ground, and walled
fast to brick-work to make it steady. Round this
centre the whole frame is moved horizontally by
means of 20 rollers, 12 upon the outer, and 8
upon the inner wall. The vertical motion is
given to the instrument by means of ropes and
pullies, passing over the main beam supported by
the ladders. These ladders are 49 feet long, and
there is a moveable gallery with 24 rollers to ease
its motion. There is a stair-case intended for
persons who wish to ascend into the gallery,
without being obliged to go up the ladder.
The ease with which the horizontal and vertical
motions may be communicated to the tube may
be conceived, from a remark of Sir W. Herschel,
that, in the year 1789, he several times observed
Saturn, two or three hours before and after its
meridian passage with one single person to continue,
at his directions, the necessary horizontal
and vertical motions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>By this telescope the sixth and seventh satellites
of Saturn were discovered, only one of which is
within the reach of the 20 feet reflector, or even
of a 25 feet instrument. The discovery of the
satellites of the planet Uranus, however, was made
by the 20 feet reflector, but only after it had been
converted from the Newtonian to the Herschelian
construction&mdash;which affords a proof of the superiority
of the latter construction over the former
when the same speculum is used. Never had the
heavens before been observed with so extraordinary
an instrument as the forty feet reflector. The
nebulosities which are found among the fixed
stars, in various regions of the heavens, appeared
almost all to resolve themselves into an innumerable
multitude of stars; others, hitherto imperceptible,
seemed to have acquired a distinct light.
On the entrance of Sirius into the field of the
telescope, the eye was so violently affected, that
stars of less magnitude could not immediately
after be perceived; and it was necessary to wait
for 20 minutes before these stars could be observed.
The ring of Saturn had always before ceased to
be visible when its plane was directed towards the
earth; but the feeble light which it reflects in
that position was enough for Herschel’s instrument,
and the ring, even then, still remained
visible to him.</p>

<p>It has been generally considered that this telescope
was capable of carrying a power of 6000
times; and perhaps for the purpose of an experiment,
and for trying its effect on certain objects,
such a power may have been applied,&mdash;in which
case the eye-glass must have been only <sup>2</sup>/<sub>25</sub> of an
inch focal distance, or somewhat less than one
twelfth of an inch. But such a power could not
be generally applied, with any good effect, to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
planetary bodies; and I question much whether
any power above 1000 times was ever generally
used. For, it is the quantity of light which the
telescope collects, more than the magnifying
power, that enables us to penetrate, with effect,
into the distant spaces of the firmament: and
hence, as above stated, the power seldom exceeded
200, which on account of the large diameter of
the speculum, would enable the instrument to
penetrate into the distant celestial spaces perhaps
further than if a power of as many thousands of
times had been applied.</p>

<p>Sir John Herschel, who inherits all the science,
skill, and industry of his father, some time ago
ground and polished a new speculum for the 20
feet tube, formerly noticed, which is connected
with a stand, pulleys and other appendages, similar
to those above described, though of smaller dimensions.
This telescope shows the double stars
exceedingly well defined, and was one of the
principal instruments used in forming his catalogue
of these objects which was presented to the Royal
Society, in conjunction with that of Sir James
South, about the year 1828. I suppose, it is
likewise the same telescope with which Sir John
lately made his Sidereal observations at the Cape
of Good Hope.</p>

<h4 id="RAMAGES_LARGE_REFLECTING_TELESCOPE">SECT. 3.&mdash;RAMAGE’S LARGE REFLECTING TELESCOPE.</h4>

<p>The largest <i>front view</i> reflecting telescope in
this country&mdash;next to Herschel’s 40 feet instrument&mdash;is
that which was erected at the Royal
Observatory at Greenwich, in the year 1820, by
Mr. Ramage of Aberdeen. The diameter of the
concave reflector is 15 inches, and its focal length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
25 feet. It is erected on machinery which bears
a certain resemblance to that of Herschel’s, which
we have now described; but the mechanical arrangements
are greatly simplified, so that the instrument
is manageable by an observer without
an assistant. The tube is composed of a twelve-sided
prism of deal <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. At the mouth
is a double cylinder of different diameters on the
same axis; around this a cord is wound by a
winch, and passes up from the small cylinder, over
a pulley, and down through another pulley on to
the large cylinder. When the winch, therefore,
is turned to raise the telescope, the endless cord
is unwound from the smaller cylinder, and wound
on to the larger, the difference of the size of the
two cylinders will be double the quantity raised,
and a mechanical force to any extent may thus be
obtained, by duly proportioning the diameters of
the two cylinders: by this contrivance the necessity
of an assistant is superseded. The view
through this instrument first astonished those observers
who had not been accustomed to examine
a heavenly body with a telescope possessing so much
light; and its performance was deemed quite extraordinary.
But when the first impression had subsided,
and different trials had been made in different
states of the atmosphere, it was discovered
that the central portion of the speculum was
more perfectly figured than the ring bordering on
the extreme edges. When the aperture was
limited to ten or twelve inches, the performance
as to the distinctness in its defining power, was
greatly improved, and the light was so brilliant,
that the Astronomer Royal was disposed to entertain
an opinion, that it might equal that of a good
achromatic refractor of the same dimensions.
When, however, very small and obscure objects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
are to be observed, the whole light of the entire
aperture may be used with advantage on favourable
evenings.</p>

<p>The eye-pieces adapted to this telescope have
powers which magnify the object linearly from
100 to 1500 times, which are competent to fulfil
all the purposes of vision when cleared of aberration.
When the telescope is placed in the plane
of the meridian and elevated together with the
gallery, into any required altitude, the <i>meridional
sweeps</i>, formerly practised by Sir W. Herschel,
and continued by Sir John with great success, in
the examination of double stars and nebula, may
be managed with great ease.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramage had a telescope of about the same
size, erected in an open space in Aberdeen, which
I had an opportunity of inspecting when I paid
a visit to that gentleman in 1833; but cloudy
weather prevented my obtaining a view of any
celestial bodies through it. He showed me at that
time two or three large speculums, from 12 to 18
inches in diameter, which he had finished some
time before, and which appeared most beautifully
polished. He told me, too, that he had ground
and polished them simply with his hand, without
the aid of any machinery or mechanical power&mdash;a
circumstance which, he said, astonished the opticians
of London, when it was stated, and which
they considered as almost incredible. His experience
in casting and polishing metals of various
sizes, during a period of 15 or 16 years, qualified
him to prepare specula of great lustre, and with
an unusually high polish. It has been asserted
that a fifty feet telescope by Ramage of 21 inches
aperture was intended to be substituted for the
25 feet instrument erected at Greenwich, and the
speculum it is understood, was prepared, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
ready for use, provided the Navy Board was disposed
to defray the expense of carrying the plan
into execution. But, unfortunately, this ingenious
artist was unexpectedly cut off in the midst
of his career, about the year 1835.</p>

<h4 id="THE_AERIAL_REFLECTOR_CONSTRUCTED_BY_THE_AUTHOR">SECT. 4.&mdash;THE AERIAL REFLECTOR&mdash;CONSTRUCTED
BY THE AUTHOR.</h4>

<p>A particular description of this telescope was
given in the ‘Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal’ for April&mdash;July, 1826, conducted by
Professor Jameson, the greater part of which was
copied in the ‘London Encyclopedia,’ ] under the
article <i>Telescope</i>. From this description I shall
endeavour to condense a brief account of this instrument
with a few additional remarks.</p>

<p>About the year 1822, an old speculum 27 inches
in focal length, very imperfectly polished happened
accidentally to come into my possession; and
feeling no inclination to fit it up in the Gregorian
form, I formed the resolution of throwing aside
the small speculum, and attempting the <i>front view</i>
notwithstanding the uniform assertion of opticians,
that such an attempt in instruments of a small
size is impracticable. I had some ground for expecting
success in this attempt, from several experiments
I had previously made, particularly from
some modifications I had made in the construction
of astronomical eye-pieces, which have a tendency
to correct the aberration of the rays of light,
when they proceed somewhat obliquely from a
lens or speculum. In the first instance, I placed
the speculum at the one end of a tube of the form
of a segment of a cone&mdash;the end next the eye being
somewhat wider than that at which the speculum
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
was fixed, and its length about an inch shorter
than the focal distance of the mirror. A small
tube for receiving the different eye-pieces was
fixed in the inside of the large tube at the end
next the eye, and connected with an apparatus by
which it could occasionally be moved either in a
vertical or horizontal direction. With the instrument
fitted up in this manner, I obtained some
interesting views of the moon, and of terrestrial
objects. But finding that one side of the tube
intercepted a considerable portion of light from
the object, I determined to throw aside the tube
altogether, and to fit up the instrument on a different
plan.</p>

<p>A short mahogany tube, about 3 inches long,
was prepared, to serve as a socket for holding the
speculum. To the side of this tube an arm was
attached, about the length of the focal distance of
the mirror, at the extremity of which a brass tube
for receiving the eye-pieces, was fixed, connected
with screws and sockets, by which it might be
raised or depressed, and turned to the right hand
or to the left, and with adjusting apparatus by
which it might be brought nearer to or farther from
the speculum. Fig. 69 exhibits a general representation
of the instrument in profile. AB is the
short tube which holds the speculum; CD the
arm which carries the eye-tubes, which consists of
two distinct pieces of mahogany; the part D
being capable of sliding along the under side of
C, through the brass sockets EF. To the under
part of the socket F is attached a brass nut with
a female screw, in which the male screw <i>ab</i> acts
by applying the hand to the knob <i>c</i>, which serves
for adjusting the instrument to distinct vision. G
is the brass tube which receives the eye-pieces.
It is supported by a strong brass wire <i>de</i>, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
passes through a nut connected with another
strong wire, which passes through the arm D. By
means of the nut <i>f</i> this tube may be elevated or
depressed, and firmly fixed in its proper position;
and by the nut <i>d</i> it may be brought nearer to or
further from, the arm D.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 69.</i></p>
<img id="fig069" src="images/fig069.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>By the same apparatus, it is also rendered capable
of being moved either in a vertical or horizontal
direction: but when it is once adjusted to its
proper position, it must be firmly fixed, and
requires no further attention. The eye-piece represented
in this figure is the one used for terrestrial
objects, which consists of the tubes belonging
to a pocket achromatic telescope. When an astronomical
eye-piece is used, the length of the
instrument extends only to the point I. In looking
through this telescope, the right eye is applied
at the point H, and the observer’s head is understood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
to be uncovered, or, at least, tightly covered
with a thin cap. For those who use only the left
eye, the arm would require to be placed on the
opposite side of the tube, or the arm, along with
the tube, be made to turn round 180 degrees.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 70.</i></p>
<img id="fig070" src="images/fig070.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 70 represents a front, or rather an oblique
view of the instrument, in which the position of
the speculum may be seen. All the specula which
I fitted up in this form, having been originally
intended for Gregorian reflectors, have holes in
their centres. The eye-piece is therefore directed
to a point nearly equi-distant from the hole to
the left hand edge of the speculum, that is, to the
point <i>a</i>. In one of these instruments fitted up
with a four feet speculum, the line of vision is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
directed to the point <i>b</i> on the opposite side of the
speculum, but, in this case, the eye-tube is removed
farther from the arm, than in the former
case. The hole in the centre of the speculum is
obviously a defect in this construction of a reflecting
telescope, as it prevents us from obtaining the
full advantage of the rays which fall near the
centre of the mirror; yet the performance of the
instruments, even with this disadvantage, is superior
to what we should previously have been led to
expect.</p>

<p>The principal nicety in the construction of this
instrument, consists in the adjustment and proper
direction of the eye-tube. There is only one
position in which vision will be perfectly distinct.
It must be neither too high nor too low,&mdash;it must
be fixed at a certain distance from the arm,&mdash;and
must be directed to a certain point of the speculum.
This position must be ultimately determined
by experiment, when viewing terrestrial objects.
A person unacquainted with this construction of
the telescope, would, perhaps, find it difficult, in
the first instance, to make this adjustment; but
were it at any time deranged, through accident or
otherwise, I can easily make the adjustment anew,
in the course of a minute or two.</p>

<p>In pointing this telescope to the object intended
to be viewed, the eye is applied at K, fig, 69, and
looking along the arm, towards the eye-piece, till it
nearly coincide with the object, it will, in most
cases, be readily found. In this way I can easily
point this instrument to Jupiter or Saturn, or to
any of the other planets, visible to the naked eye,
even when a power of 160 or 170 times is applied.
When high magnifying powers, however, are used,
it may be expedient to fix, on the upper part of
the short tube in which the speculum rests, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Finder, such as that which is used in Newtonian
telescopes. When the moon is the object intended
to be viewed, she may be instantly found by
moving the instrument till her reflected image be
seen from the eye-end of the telescope on the face
of the mirror.</p>

<p>I have fitted up several instruments of the
above description with specula of 16, 27, 35, and
49 inches focal distance. One of these having a
speculum of 27 inches focal length, and an astronomical
eye-piece, producing a magnifying power
of about 90 times, serves as a good astronomical
telescope. By this instrument the belts and satellites
of Jupiter, the ring of Saturn, and the mountains
and cavities of the moon, may be contemplated
with great ease and distinctness. With a
magnifying power of 35 or 40 times, terrestrial
objects appear remarkably bright and well-defined.
When compared with a Gregorian, the quantity of
light upon the object appears nearly doubled, and
the image is equally distinct&mdash;although the speculum
has several blemishes, and its surface is but
imperfectly polished. It represents objects in
their natural colours, without that dingy and yellowish
tinge which appears when looking through
a Gregorian. Another of these instruments is
about four feet long. The speculum which
belongs to it is a very old one: when it came into
my possession, it was so completely tarnished, as
scarcely to reflect a ray of light. After it was
cleaned, it appeared to be scarcely half polished,
and its surface is covered with yellowish stains
which cannot be erased. Were it fitted up upon
the Gregorian plan, it would, I presume, be of
very little use, unless when a very small magnifying
power was applied. Yet, in its present form,
it bears, with distinctness, a magnifying power of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
130 times, and is equal in its performance to a 3&frac12;
feet achromatic. It exhibits distinct and interesting
views of the diversities of shade, and of the
mountains, vales, cavities, and other inequalities
of the moon’s surface. With a power of about
50 times, and a terrestrial eye-piece, it forms an
excellent telescope for land objects, and exhibits
them in a brilliant and novel aspect. The smallest
instrument I have attempted to construct on this
plan, is only 5&frac12; inches focal distance, and 1&frac34; inch
diameter. With a magnifying power of about 15
times, it shows terrestrial objects with distinctness
and brilliancy. But I should deem it inexpedient
to fit up any instrument of this description with
specula of a shorter focal distance than 20 or 24
inches. The longer the focal distance the more
distinctness may be expected, although the aperture
of the speculum should be comparatively
small.</p>

<p>The following are some of the properties and
advantages peculiar to this construction of the
reflecting telescope.</p>

<p>1. It is <i>extremely simple</i>, and may be fitted up
at a comparatively <i>small expense</i>. Instead of
large and expensive brass tubes, such as are used
in the Gregorian and Newtonian construction,
little more is required than a short mahogany
tube, two or three inches long, to serve as a socket
for the speculum, with an arm connected with it
about the focal length of the speculum. The expense
of small specula, either plain or concave,
is saved, together with the numerous screws,
springs, &amp;c., for centering the two specula, and
placing the small mirror parallel to the large one.
The only adjustment requisite in this construction,
is that of the eye-tube to the speculum; and, by
means of the simple apparatus above described, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
can be effected in the course of a few minutes.
Almost the whole expense of the instrument consists
in the price of the speculum and the eye-pieces.
The expense of fitting up the four feet
speculum, alluded to above&mdash;<i>exclusive of speculum
and eye-piece</i>&mdash;but including mahogany tube
and arm, brass sockets, screws, eye-tube, brass
joint, and a cast-iron stand painted and varnished,
did not amount to &pound;1 : 8<i>s</i>. A Gregorian of the
same size would have required a brass tube at
least 4&frac12; feet in length, which would cost 5
or 6 guineas, besides the apparatus connected
with the small speculum, and the additional expense
connected with the fitting up of the joint
and stand requisite for supporting and steadying
so unwieldy an instrument. While the one instrument
would require two persons to carry it
from one room to another, and would occupy a
considerable space in an ordinary apartment, the
other can be moved, with the utmost ease, with
one hand, to any moderate distance, and the space
it occupies is extremely small.</p>

<p>2. <i>It is more convenient for viewing celestial
objects at a high altitude, than other telescopes.</i>
When we look through a Gregorian reflector or
an achromatic telescope of 4 or 5 feet in length,
to an object elevated 50 or 60 degrees above the
horizon, the body requires to be placed in an
uneasy and distorted position, and the eye is
somewhat strained, while the observation is continued.
But when viewing similar objects by the
<i>Aerial Reflector</i>, we can either stand perfectly
erect, or sit on a chair, with the same ease as we
sit at a desk when reading a book or writing a
letter. In this way, the surface of the moon or
any of the planets, may be contemplated for an
hour or two, without the least weariness or fatigue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
A delineation of the lunar surface may be taken
with this instrument with more ease and accuracy
than with any other instrument, as the observer
can sketch the outline of the object by one eye
on a tablet placed a little below the eye-piece,
while the other eye is looking at the object.
For the purpose of accommodating the instrument
to a sitting or standing posture a small table was
constructed, capable of being elevated or depressed
at pleasure, on which the stand of the telescope is
placed. When the telescope is 4 or 5 feet long,
and the object at a very high elevation, the instrument
may be placed on the floor of the apartment,
and the observer will stand in an erect position.</p>

<p>3. This instrument is considerably <i>shorter</i> than
a Gregorian telescope whose mirror is of the
same focal length. When an astronomical eye-piece
is used, the whole length of the instrument
is nothing more than the focal length of the speculum.
But a Gregorian whose large speculum is
4 feet focus, will be nearly 5 feet in length, including
the eye-piece.</p>

<p>4. The Aerial Reflector far excels the Gregorian
in brightness. The deficiency of light in the
Gregorians is owing to the second reflection from
the small mirror; for it has been proved by experiment
that nearly the one half of the rays of
light which fall upon a reflecting surface is lost by
a second reflection. The image of the object may
also be presumed to be more correct, as it is not
liable to any distortion by being reflected from
another speculum.</p>

<p>5. There is <i>less tremor</i> in these telescopes than
in Gregorian Reflectors. One cause, among
others, of the tremors complained of in Gregorians
is, I presume, the formation of a second
image at a great distance from the first, besides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
that which arises from the elastic tremor of the
small speculum, when carried by an arm supported
only at one end. But as the image formed by
the speculum in the aerial telescope is viewed
<i>directly</i>, without being exposed to any subsequent
reflection, it is not so liable to the tremors which
are so frequently experienced in other reflectors.
Notwithstanding the length of the arm of the 4
feet telescope above mentioned, a celestial object
appears remarkably steady, when passing across
the field of view, especially when it is at a moderate
degree of altitude; and it is easily kept in
the field by a gentle motion applied to the arm of
the instrument.</p>

<p>In prosecuting my experiments in relation to
these instruments, I wished to ascertain what
effect might be produced by using a <i>part of a
speculum</i> instead of the whole. For this purpose,
I cut a speculum, three feet in focal length,
through the centre, so as to divide it into two equal
parts, and fitted up each part as a distinct telescope;
so that I obtained two telescopes from one
speculum. In this case I found that each half of
the speculum performed nearly as well as the
whole speculum had done before, at least there
appeared to be <i>no very sensible</i> diminution in the
<i>brightness</i> of the object, when viewed with a
moderate power, and the image was equally accurate
and distinct; so that if <i>economy</i> were a particular
object aimed at in the construction of these
instruments, two good telescopes might be obtained
from one speculum; or if a speculum happened
to be broken accidentally into large fragments, one
or more of the fragments might be fitted up on
this principle to serve as a tolerably good telescope.</p>

<p>From the experiments I have made in reference
to these instruments, it is demonstrable, that <i>a</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
<i>tube is not necessary</i> in the construction of a reflecting
telescope&mdash;at least on the principle now
stated&mdash;whether it be used by day or by night for
terrestrial or celestial objects; for I have frequently
used these telescopes in the open air in
the day time, without any inconvenience from extraneous
light. Therefore, were a reflecting
telescope of 50 or 60 feet in length to be constructed,
it might be fitted up at a comparatively
small expence, after the expense of the metallic
substances, and of casting, grinding, and polishing
the speculum is defrayed. The largest instrument
of this description which has hitherto been constructed
is the 40 feet reflector of Sir W. Herschel.
This complicated and most unwieldy instrument
had a tube of rolled or sheet iron 39 feet 4 inches
in length, about 15 feet in circumference, and
weighed about 8000 pounds. Now, I conceive
that such enormous tubes, in instruments of such
dimensions, are altogether unnecessary. Nothing
more is requisite than a short tube for holding the
speculum. Connected with one side of this tube
(or with both sides were it found necessary), two
strong bars of wood, projecting a few feet beyond
the speculum end, and extending in front as far
as the focal length of the mirror, and connected
by cross bars of wood, iron or brass&mdash;would be
quite sufficient for a support to the eye-piece, and
for directing the motion of the instrument. A
telescope of 40 or 50 feet in length, constructed
on this plan, would not require one fifth of the
expense, nor one fourth of the apparatus and
mechanical power for moving it to any required
position, which were found necessary in the construction
of Sir W. Herschel’s large reflecting
telescope. The idea here suggested will perhaps
be more readily appreciated by an inspection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
fig. 71, where A is the short tube, BC and DE
the two large bars or arms, connected with cross
bars, for the purpose of securing strength and
steadiness. At I and K, behind the speculum,
weights might be applied, if necessary, for counterbalancing
the lever power of the long arm. F
represents the position of the eye-piece, and GH
the joint and part of the pedestal on which the
instrument is placed. With regard to telescopes
of smaller dimensions, as from 5 to 15 feet in
focal length&mdash;with the exception of the expense
of the specula and eye-pieces&mdash;they might be
fitted up for a sum not greater than from 3 to 10
or 15 guineas.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 71.</i></p>
<img id="fig071" src="images/fig071.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Were any person to attempt the construction
of those telescopes, it is possible he might not
succeed in his first attempts without more minute
directions than I have yet given. The following
directions may perhaps tend to guide the experimenter
in adjusting the eye-tube to the speculum,
which is a point that requires to be particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
attended to, and on which depends the accurate
performance of the instrument. After having
fixed the eye-piece nearly in the position it should
occupy, and directed the instrument to a particular
object, look along the arm of the telescope, from
K (fig. 69.) to the extremity of the eye-piece at
H, and observe, whether it nearly coincides with
the object. If the object appear lower than this
line of vision, the eye-piece must be lowered, and if
higher, it must be raised, by means of the nuts
and screws at <i>gd</i> and <i>fe</i>, till the object and the line
of vision now stated nearly coincide. The eye-piece
should be directed as nearly perpendicular to the
front of the speculum as possible, but so that the
reflected image of one’s head from the mirror shall
not interfere to obstruct the rays from the object.
An object may be seen with an approximate
degree of distinctness, but not accurately, unless
this adjustment be pretty accurately made. The
astronomical eye-pieces used for these telescopes
are fitted with a brass cap which slides on the end
next the eye, and is capable of being brought
nearer to or farther from the first eye-glass. In
the centre of this cap, next the eye, is a small
hole, about the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub>th or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of an inch diameter,
or about as wide as to admit the point of a pin or
a moderate-sized needle. The distance of this
hole from the lens next the eye must be adjusted
by trial, till the whole field of view appear distinct.
A common astronomical eye-piece, without this addition,
does not answer well. I find by experience,
that terrestrial eye-pieces, such as those used in
good achromatic telescopes, are, on the whole,
best adapted to this construction of a reflecting
telescope.</p>

<p>I have sometimes used these instruments for the
purpose of viewing perspective prints, which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
exhibit in a beautiful and interesting manner. If
a coloured perspective be placed at one end of a
large room or gallery, and strongly illuminated
either by the sun or by two candles, and one of
the reflectors furnished with a <i>small magnifying
power</i>, placed at the opposite end of the room&mdash;the
representation of a street or a landscape will
be seen in its true perspective, and will appear
even more pleasant and interesting than when
viewed through the common <i>optical diagonal
machine</i>. If an inverting eye-piece be used&mdash;which
is most eligible in this experiment&mdash;the
print, of course, must be placed in an inverted
position.</p>

<p>That reflecting telescopes of the descriptions now
stated are original in their construction, appears
from the uniform language of optical writers,
some of whom have pronounced such attempts to
be altogether impracticable. Sir David Brewster,
one of the latest and most respectable writers on
this subject, in the ‘Edinburgh Encyclopedia’
art <i>optics</i>, and in the last edition of his <i>appendix</i>
to ‘Ferguson’s Lectures,’ has the following remarks:&mdash;‘If
we could dispense with the use of
the small specula in telescopes of moderate length,
by inclining the great speculum, and using an
oblique, and consequently a <i>distorted</i> reflection,
as proposed first by La Maire, we should consider
the Newtonian telescope as perfect; and on a
large scale, or when the instrument exceeds 20
feet, it has undoubtedly this character, as nothing
can be more simple than to magnify, by a single
eye-glass, the image formed by a single speculum.
As the <i>front view is quite impracticable</i>, and
indeed <i>has never been attempted</i> in instruments of
a small size, it becomes of great practicable consequence
to remove as much as possible, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
evils which arise from the use of a small speculum,’
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The instruments now described have effectuated,
in some degree, the desirable object alluded to by
this distinguished philosopher, and the mode of
construction is neither that of Sir W. Herschel’s
front view, nor does it coincide with that proposed
by La Maire, which appears to have been a mere
hint that was never realized in the construction of
reflecting telescopes of a small size. The simplicity
of the construction of these instruments, and
the excellence of their performance, have been
much admired by several scientific gentlemen and
others to whom they have been exhibited. Prior
to the description of them in the Edin. Philos.
Journal, they were exhibited in the Calton Hill
Observatory, Edinburgh, in the presence of Professor
Wallace, and another gentleman, who compared
their performance with that of an excellent
Gregorian. As this instrument is distinguished
from every other telescope, in being used without
a tube, it has been denominated ‘<i>The aerial
reflector</i>.’</p>

<h4 id="EARL_OF_ROSSES_REFLECTING_TELESCOPES">SECT. 4.&mdash;EARL OF ROSSE’S REFLECTING TELESCOPES.</h4>

<p>This nobleman, unlike many of his compeers,
has, for a considerable number of years past,
devoted his attention to the pursuits of science,
and particularly to the improvement of reflecting
telescopes. He is evidently possessed of high
mathematical attainments, combined with an uncommon
degree of mechanical ingenuity. About
14 or 15 years ago, he engaged in various experiments
with the view of counteracting the effects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
of the spherical aberration of the specula of reflecting
telescopes&mdash;which imperfection, if it could be
completely remedied, would render the reflecting
telescope almost a perfect instrument, as it is not
affected by the different refrangibility of the rays
of light. His method, we believe, consisted in
forming a large speculum of two or three separate
pieces of metal, which were afterwards accurately
combined into one&mdash;a central part which was
surrounded by one or two rings ground on the
same tool. When the images formed by the
separate pieces, were made exactly to coincide,
the image of the object towards which the whole
speculum was directed, was then found to be as
distinct as either image had been when separate.
But at the period referred to, a sufficient number
of experiments had not been made to determine
that his lordship had completely accomplished the
object he intended.</p>

<p>Great interest, however, has of late been excited
by the improvements which his lordship has
made in the formation of specula. Sir W.
Herschel never made public the means by which
he succeeded in giving such gigantic developement
to the reflecting telescope: and therefore
the construction of a <i>large</i> reflector has been considered
as a perilous adventure. But, according
to a report of Dr. Robinson of Armagh, to the
Irish academy, the Earl of Rosse has overcome
the difficulties which have hitherto been met with,
and carried to an extent which even Herschel
himself did not venture to contemplate, the
illuminating power of this telescope, along with
a sharpness of definition little inferior to that of
the achromatic; and it is scarcely possible, he
observes, to preserve the necessary sobriety of
language in speaking of the moon’s appearance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
with this instrument, which Dr. Robinson believes
to be the most powerful ever constructed. The
difficulty of constructing large specula, and of
imparting to them the requisite degree of polish,
has hitherto been considered so great, that from
8 to 12 inches diameter has been in general their
utmost size. Indeed, except with the greatest
reluctance, London opticians would not accept of
orders for specula of more than 9 inches in diameter.
It appears, however, that the Earl of Rosse
has succeeded, by a peculiar method of moulding,
in casting object-mirrors of true <i>speculum metal of
three feet in diameter, and of a weight exceeding
17 cwt</i>. He is about to construct a telescope, the
speculum of which is <i>six feet</i> in diameter, <i>fifty
feet focal distance</i>, and of the weight of <i>four tons</i>;
and from what he has already accomplished, it is
not doubted that he possesses the power to carry
his design into effect. These great masses of
metal, which, in the hands of all other makers of
specula would have been as untractable as so
much unannealed flint-glass, the Earl of Rosse
has further succeeded in bringing to the highest
degree of polish, and the utmost perfection of
curvature by means of machinery. The process is
conducted under water, by which means those
variations of temperature, so fatal to the finest
specula hitherto attempted, are effectually guarded
against. To convince Dr. Robinson of the efficacy
of this machinery, the earl took the three feet
speculum out of its telescope, destroyed its polished
surface, and placed it under the mechanical polisher.
In six hours it was taken out with a perfect new
surface as bright as the original. Under the old
system of hand-polishing, it might have required
months, and even years, to effect this restoration.
Even before achieving these extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
triumphs on the solid substance, his lordship had
constructed a six feet reflector by covering a
curved surface of brass with squares of the true
<i>speculum metal</i>, which gave an immense quantity
of light, though subject to some irregularities,
arising from the number of joinings necessary in
such a mosaic work. Of the performance of his
lordship’s great telescope, mounted with this
reflector, those who have seen it speak in terms
of high admiration; but in reference to the
smaller and more perfect instrument, furnished
with the solid three feet speculum, the language
of the Armagh astronomer assumes a tone of
enthusiasm and even of sublimity. By means of
this exquisite instrument, Dr. Robinson and Sir
J. South, in the intervals of a rather unfavourable
night, saw several new stars, and corrected
numerous errors of other observers. For example,
the planet Uranus, supposed to possess a ring
similar to that of Saturn, was found not to have
any such appendage; and those nebul&aelig;, hitherto
regarded, from their apparently circular outline,
as ‘coalescing systems,’ appeared, when tested by
the three feet speculum, to be very far indeed
from presenting a globular appearance; numerous
off-shoots and appendages, invisible by other telescopes,
appearing in all directions radiating from
their edges. Such discoveries, which reflect great
honour on the Earl of Rosse, will doubtless have
great effect on the interests of astronomical
science.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>

<h4 id="REFLECTING_TELESCOPES_WITH_GLASS_SPECULA">SECT. 5.&mdash;REFLECTING TELESCOPES WITH GLASS
SPECULA.</h4>

<p>After making a variety of experiments with
aerial telescopes constructed of metallic specula of
different focal lengths, I constructed a telescope
on the same plan, with a concave glass mirror.
Having obtained a fragment of a very large convex
mirror which happened accidentally to have
been broken, I caused the convex side to be
foliated, or silverised, and found its focal length to
be about 27 inches. This mirror, which was
about 5 inches diameter, I placed in one of the
aerial reflectors, instead of the metallic speculum,
and tried its effects with different terrestrial eye-pieces.
With a power of about 35 or 40 times, it
gave a beautiful and splendid view of distant
terrestrial objects&mdash;the quantity of light reflected
from them, being considerably greater than when
a metallic speculum was used, and they appeared
on the whole well-defined. The only imperfection&mdash;as
I had foreseen&mdash;consisted in a double
image being formed of objects which were remarkably
bright and white, such as a light-house whitened
on the outside, and strongly illuminated by
the sun. One of the images was bright and the
other faint. This was obviously owing to the two
reflections from the two surfaces of the mirror&mdash;one
from the convex silverised side, and the other
from the concave side next the eye, which produced
the faint image&mdash;which circumstance has
been generally considered as a sufficient reason for
rejecting the use of glass specula in telescopes.
But although very bright objects exhibited a
double image, almost all the other objects in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
terrestrial landscape appeared quite distinct and
without any secondary image, so that a common
observer could scarcely have noticed any imperfection.
When the instrument, however, was
directed to celestial objects, the secondary image
was somewhat vivid, so that every object appeared
double. Jupiter appeared with two bodies, at a
little distance from each other, and his four satellites
appeared increased to eight. The moon likewise
appeared as a double orb, but the principal
image was distinct and well-defined. Such a telescope,
therefore, was not well-adapted for celestial
observations, but might answer well enough for
viewing terrestrial objects.</p>

<p>Considering that the injurious effects of the
secondary image arose from the images reflected
from the two surfaces being formed near the same
point, and at nearly the same focal distance, I
formed a plan for destroying the secondary image,
or at least counteracting its effects, by forming
the concavity of the mirror next the eye of a portion
of a sphere <i>different</i> from that of the convex
side which was silverised, and from which the
principal image is formed. But, for a long time,
I could find no opticians possessed of tools of a
sufficient length of radii for accomplishing my
design. At length a London working optician
undertook to finish a glass speculum, according to
my directions, which were, that the convex surface
of the mirror should be ground on a tool
which would produce a focal distance by reflection
of about 4 feet; and that the concave surface
should have its focal distance at about 3 feet 3
inches, so that the secondary image might be
formed at about 9 inches, within the focal distance
of the silverised side, and not interfere to disturb
the principal image. But, either from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
ignorance or inattention, the artist mistook the
radius for the half radius of concavity, and the
speculum turned out to be only 23 inches focal
distance by reflection. This mirror was fitted up
as a telescope, on the aerial plan, and I found, as
I expected, the secondary image completely
destroyed. It produced a very beautiful and
brilliant view of land objects, and even the brightest
objects exhibited no double image. The mirror
was nearly 5 inches in diameter, but the image
was most accurately defined when the aperture
was contracted to about 3 inches. It was fitted
with a terrestrial eye-piece which produced a
magnifying power of about 25 times. When
directed to the moon, it gave a very distinct and
luminous view of that orb, without the least
appearance of a secondary image. But as the
focal distance of the speculum was scarcely half the
length I had prescribed, I did not apply to it any
high astronomical powers; as I find, that these
can only be applied with effect, in this construction,
to a speculum of a considerable focal length.
Happening to have at hand a convex lens 10 feet
focal length, and 4 inches in diameter&mdash;the one
side of which had been ground to a certain degree
of concavity&mdash;I caused the convex side to be
foliated, which produced a focus by reflection, at
13&frac12; inches distant. To this mirror I applied
terrestrial powers of 15 and 24, with considerable
distinctness. The power of 15 produced a very
brilliant and distinct view of land objects. Had
the mirror been at least 3 times the focal length,
it would have formed an excellent telescope, with
the same aperture.

<h4 id="A_REFLECTING_TELESCOPE_WITH_A_SINGLE_MIRROR_AND_NO_EYE_PIECE">SECT. 6.&mdash;A REFLECTING TELESCOPE, WITH A
SINGLE MIRROR AND NO EYE-PIECE.</h4>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 72.</i></p>
<img id="fig072" src="images/fig072.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>On the same principle as that by which a refracting
telescope may be constructed by means of a
single lens&mdash;as represented fig. 51, (page 234)
we may form a telescope by reflection with a
single mirror, and without an eye-piece. Let
AB, fig. 72, represent a large concave speculum,
and C its focus&mdash;if an eye be placed at D, about
8 or 10 inches within the focal point C, all the
objects in the direction of C, or behind the spectator,
will be seen magnified by reflection on
the face of the mirror, and strongly illuminated.
The magnifying power, in this case, will be nearly
in the proportion of the focal length of the mirror
to the focal length of the eye for near objects.
If for example, the focal distance of the mirror be
8 feet, and the distance from the eye at which we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
see near objects most distinctly, be 8 inches&mdash;the
magnifying power will be in the ratio of 8
to 96, or 12 times. I have a glass mirror of this
description, whose focal length is 4 feet 8 inches,
and diameter 6 inches, which magnifies distant
objects about 7 times, takes in a large field of
view, and exhibits objects with great brilliancy.
It presents a very distinct picture of the moon,
showing the different streaks of light and shade
upon her surface; and, in some cases, shows the
larger spots which traverse the solar disc. This
mode of viewing objects is extremely easy and
pleasant, especially when the mirror is of a large
diameter; and the observer is at first struck and
gratified with the novel aspect in which the objects
appear.</p>

<p>Were a concave mirror of this description&mdash;whether
of glass or of speculum metal&mdash;to be
formed to a very long focus, the magnifying power
would be considerable. One of 50 feet focal
length, and of a corresponding diameter, might
produce a magnifying power, to certain eyes, of
about 75 times; and, from the quantity of light
with which the object would be seen, its effect
would be much greater than the same power
applied to a common telescope. Sir W. Herschel
states, that, on one occasion, by looking with
his naked eye on the speculum of his 40 feet
Reflector, without the interposition of any lens
or mirror, he perceived distinctly one of the satellites
of Saturn, which requires the application of
a considerable power to be seen by an ordinary
telescope. Such an instrument is one of the most
simple forms of a telescope, and would exhibit a
brilliant and interesting view of the moon, or of
terrestrial objects.

<p>Although the performance of telescopes chiefly
depends on the goodness of the object-glass, or
the object-speculum of the instrument, yet it is
of considerable importance, in order to distinct
vision, and to obtain a large and uniformly distinct
field of view, that the eye-piece be properly constructed.
The different kinds of eye-pieces may
be arranged into two general divisions&mdash;<i>Astronomical</i>
and <i>terrestrial</i>.</p>

<p id="ASTRONOMICAL_EYE_PIECES">1. <i>Astronomical eye-pieces.</i>&mdash;The most simple
astronomical eye-piece is that which consists of a
single convex lens; and when the focal distance
of this lens, and that of the object-glass of the
instrument is accurately ascertained, the magnifying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
power may be nicely determined, by dividing
the focal length of the object-lens by that of the
eye-glass. But, as the pencil of white light transmitted
by the object-glass, will be divided by the
eye-glass into its component colours, the object
will appear bordered with coloured fringes, and
the distinctness of vision consequently injured.
Besides, the spherical aberration, when a single
lens is used, is much greater than when two or
more glasses are employed. Hence astronomical
eye-pieces are now formed by a combination of at
least two lenses.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 73.</i></p>
<img id="fig073" src="images/fig073.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The combination of lenses now generally used
for astronomical purposes, is that which is usually
denominated the <i>Huygenian eye-piece</i>, having been
first proposed by the celebrated Huygens, as a
great improvement on the single lens eye-piece.
The following figure (73) represents a section of
this eye-piece. Let AB be a compounded pencil
of white light proceeding from the object-glass;
BF a plano-convex field-glass, with its plane side
next the eye-glass E. The red rays of the pencil
AB, after refraction would cross the axis in R,
and the violet rays in V, but meeting the eye-glass
E, the red rays will be refracted to O, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
the violet nearly in the same direction, when they
will cross each other about the point O, in the
axis, and unite. The distance of the two glasses
FE, to produce this correction, when made of
crown glass, must be equal to half the sum of
their focal distances nearly. For example, suppose
the focal distance of the largest, or field lens,
to be 3 inches, and the focal distance of the lens
next the eye, 1 inch, the two lenses should be
placed exactly at the distance of 2 inches; the
sum of their focal length being 4, the half of
which is 2. In other words, the glass next the
eye should be placed as much <i>within</i> the focus of
the field-glass as is equal to its own focal distance.
The focal length of a single lens, that has the
same magnifying power as this compound eye-piece&mdash;is
equal to twice the product of the focal
lengths of the two lenses, divided by the sum of
the same numbers. Or, it is equal to half the
focal length of the field-glass. Thus, in reference
to the preceding example, twice the product of
the focal length of the two lenses&mdash;is equal to 6,
and their sum is 4. The former number divided
by the latter, produces a quotient of 1&frac12;, which is
the focal length of a single lens, which would produce
the same magnifying power as the eye-piece;
and 1&frac12; is just half the focal length of the field-glass.
The proportion of the focal lengths of the
two lenses to each other, according to Huygens,
should be as 3 to 1; that is, if the field-glass be
4&frac12; inches, the eye-glass should be 1&frac12;; and this is
the proportion most generally adopted. But some
opticians have recommended that the proportions
should be as 3 to 2. Boscovich recommended two
similar lenses; and in this case the distance between
them was equal to half the sum of their
focal distances, as in the Huygenian eye-piece.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>The image is formed at IM, at the focal distance
of the lens next the eye, and at the same
distance from the field-glass. When distinct vision
is the principal object of an achromatic telescope,
the two lenses are usually both plano-convex,
and fixed with their curved faces towards the object
glass, as in the figure. Sometimes, however,
they consist of what is called <i>crossed</i> lenses, that
is lenses ground on one side to a short focus, and
on the other side to a pretty long focus, the sides
with the deepest curves being turned towards the
object glass. A diaphragm, or aperture of a
proper diameter, is placed at the focus of the eye
lens, where the image formed by the object-glass
falls, for the purpose of cutting off the extreme
rays of the field lens, and rendering every part of
the field of view equally distinct. This is likewise
the form of the eye-piece generally applied
to Gregorian reflectors. In short, when accurately
constructed, it is applicable to telescopes of
every description. This eye-piece, having the
image viewed, by the eye behind the inner lens,
is generally called the <i>negative</i> eye-piece, and is
that which the optical-instrument makers usually
supply, of three or four different sizes, for so many
magnifying powers, to be applied to different celestial
objects, according to their nature or the state
of the atmosphere in which they are used.</p>

<p><i>Ramsden’s eye-piece.</i>&mdash;There is another modification
of lenses, known by the name of the
<i>Positive</i>, or Ramsden’s eye-piece, which is much
used in Transit instruments, and telescopes which
are furnished with micrometers, and which affords
equally good vision as the other eye-piece. In
this construction the lenses are plano-convex, and
nearly of the same focus, but are placed at a distance
from each other less than the focal distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
of the glass next the eye, so that the image of
the object viewed is beyond both the lenses, when
measuring from the eye. The flat faces of the
two lenses are turned into contrary directions in
this eye-piece&mdash;one facing the object-glass, and
the other the eye of the observer; and as the image
formed at the focus of the object-glass, lies parallel
to the flat face of the contiguous lens, every
part of the field of view is distinct at the same
adjustment, or, as opticians say, there is a <i>flat
field</i>, which, without a diaphragm, prevents distortion
of the object. This eye-piece is represented
in fig. 74, where AB and CD are two plano-convex
lenses, with their convex sides inwards. They
have nearly the same focal length, and are placed
at a distance from each other, equal to about two
thirds of the focal length of either. The focal
length of an equivalent single lens is equal to three
fourths the focal length of either lens, supposing
them to have equal focal distances. This eye-piece
is generally applied, when wires of spider’s
lines are used in the common focus; as the piece
containing the lenses can be taken out without
disturbing the lines, and is adjustable for distinct
vision; and whatever may be the measure of any
object given by the wire micrometer, at the solar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
focus, it is not altered by a change of the magnifying
power, when a second eye-piece of this construction
is substituted.</p>

<p><i>Aberration of lenses.</i>&mdash;In connection with the
above descriptions, the following statements respecting
the spherical aberration of lenses may
not be inappropriate. Mr. John Dollond, in a
letter to Mr. Short, remarks, that ‘the aberration
in a single lens is as the cube of the refracted
angle; but if the refraction be caused by two
lenses, the sum of the cubes of each half will
be &frac14; of the refracted angle, twice the cube of 1
being &frac14; the cube of 2. So three times the cube
of 1 is only <i>one ninth</i> of the cube of 3.’ &amp;c.
Hence the indistinctness of the borders of the
field of view of a telescope is diminished by increasing
the number of lenses in an eye piece.
Sir J. Herschel has shown that if two plano-convex
lenses are put together as in fig. 75, the aberration
will be only 0.2481, or <i>one fourth</i> of that
of a single lens in its best form. The focal length
of the first of these lenses, must be to that of the
second as 1 to 2.3. If their focal lengths are equal,
the aberration will be 0.603, or nearly one half.
The spherical aberration, however, may be <i>entirely</i>
destroyed by combining a meniscus and double
convex lens, as shown in fig. 76, the convex sides
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
being turned to the eye when they are used as
lenses, and to parallel rays, when they are used as
burning glasses. Sir J. Herschel has computed
the following curvatures for such lenses.</p>

<p>On the general principles above stated, a good
astronomical eye-piece may be easily constructed
with two proper lenses, either according to the
plan of Huygens or that of Ramsden; and, from
what has been now stated it is demonstrably certain,
that, in all cases where two glasses are properly
combined, such an eye-piece is superior to
a single lens, both in point of distinctness, and of
the enlargement of the field of view. I lately
fitted up an eye-piece, on Ramsden’s principle,
with two lenses, each about 3 inches focal length,
and 1⅜ inch diameter, placed at half an inch distant,
with their convex surfaces facing each other
as in fig. 74, which forms an excellent eye-piece
for an achromatic telescope, 6 feet 8 inches focal
distance, and 4 inches aperture, particularly for
viewing clusters of stars, the Milky Way, and
the large nebul&aelig;. The field of view is large, the
magnifying power is only between 50 and 60
times, and the quantity of light being so great,
every celestial object appears with great brilliancy,
and it is in general much preferable, when applied
to the stars than any of the higher powers. When
applied to <i>Presepe</i> in Cancer, it exhibits that
group at one view, as consisting of nearly a 100
stars which exhibit a beautiful and most striking
appearance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<p>It may appear a curious circumstance that any
eye-piece which is good with a short telescope, is
also good with a long one, but that the reverse is
not true; for it is found to be more difficult to
make a good eye-piece for a short than for a long
focal distance of the object-glass.</p>

<p>Celestial eye-pieces are sometimes constructed
so as to produce <i>variable powers</i>. This is effected
by giving a motion to the lens next the eye, so as
to remove it nearer to or farther from the field
lens; for at every different distance at which it is
placed from the other lens, the magnifying power
will either be increased or diminished. The
greatest power is when the two lenses are nearly
in contact, and the power diminishes in proportion
to the distance at which the glass next the
eye is removed from the other. The scale of distance,
however, between the two lenses, cannot
be greater than the focal distance of the field, or
inner glass; for if it were, the lenses would no
longer form an eye-piece, but would be changed
into an inverting opera-glass. For effecting the
purpose now stated, the eye-glass is fixed in a tube
which slides upon an interior tube on which is
marked a scale of distances, corresponding to certain
magnifying powers; and, in this way an eye-piece
may be made to magnify about double the
number of times, when the lenses are in one position
than when they are in another&mdash;as, for example,
all the powers from 36 to 72 times may be
thus applied, merely by regulating the distance
between the two lenses. When the glasses are
varied in this manner the eye-piece becomes
sometimes a <i>positive</i> eye-piece, like Ramsden’s,
and sometimes a negative one like that of
Huygens.</p>

<p><i>Diagonal eye-pieces.</i> The eye-pieces to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
we have now adverted, when adapted to refracting
telescopes, both reverse and invert the object, and
therefore are not calculated for showing terrestrial
objects in their natural position. But as the
heavenly bodies are of a spherical form, this circumstance
detracts nothing from their utility.
When the celestial object, however, is at a high
altitude, the observer is obliged to place his head
in a very inconvenient position, and to direct his
eye nearly upwards; in which position he cannot
remain long at ease, or observe with a steady eye.
To remedy this inconvenience, the diagonal eye-piece
has been invented, which admits of the eye
being applied at the side&mdash;or at the upper part of
the eye-piece, instead of the end; and when such
an eye-piece is used, it is of no importance in
what direction the telescope is elevated, as the
observer can then either sit or stand erect, and
look down upon the object with the utmost ease.
This object is effected by placing a flat piece of
polished speculum-metal at an angle of 45
degrees in respect to the two lenses of the eye-piece,
which alters the direction of the converging
rays, and forms an image which becomes erect
with respect to altitude, but is reversed with
respect to azimuth;&mdash;that is, in other words,
when we look down upon the objects in the field
of view, they appear erect; but that part of an
object which is in reality on our right hand appears
on our left; and if it be in motion, its <i>apparent</i>
is opposite to its <i>real</i> motion; if it be moving
towards the west, it will seem to move towards
the east.</p>

<p>There are three situations in which the diagonal
reflector in this eye-piece may be placed. It
may be placed either 1. before the eye-piece,&mdash;or
2. behind it,&mdash;or 3. between the two lenses of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
which the eye-piece consists. The most common
position of the reflector is between the lenses; and
this may be done both in the negative and the
positive eye-pieces; but as the distance between
the two lenses is necessarily considerable, to make
room for the diagonal position of the reflector, the
magnifying power cannot be great; otherwise, a
diagonal eye-piece of this construction remains
always in adjustment, and is useful in all cases
where a high power is not required. The following
is a description and representation of a
diagonal eye-piece of this kind in my possession.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 77.</i></p>
<img id="fig077" src="images/fig077.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In fig. 77, AB represents the plano-convex lens
next the object, which is about 2 inches in focal
length, and &frac34; inch in diameter; CD, a plain
metallic speculum of an oval form, well polished,
and placed at half a right angle to the axis of the
tube; and EF another plano-convex lens, about
1&frac12; inch focal distance. The centre of the speculum
is about 1&frac14; inch from the lens AB, and about
&frac12; or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> inch from EF; so that this eye-piece is a
<i>positive</i> one, on the principle proposed by Ramsden.
The rays proceeding from the lens AB, and
falling upon the speculum, are reflected in a perpendicular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
direction to the lens EF, where they
enter the eye at G, which looks down upon the
object through the side of the tube. The real
size of this eye-piece is much about the same as
that represented in the figure. When applied to
an achromatic telescope of 44&frac12; inches focal distance
it produces a magnifying power of 36 times,
and exhibits a very beautiful view of the whole of
the full moon. It likewise presents a very pleasing
prospect of terrestrial objects, which appear
as if situated immediately below us.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 78.</i></p>
<img id="fig078" src="images/fig078.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Another plan of the diagonal eye-piece is represented
in fig. 78, where the speculum is fixed
<i>within</i> the sliding tube which receives the eye-piece,
or immediately below it. The part of the
tube at AB slides into the tube of the telescope,
CD is the speculum placed at half a right angle
to the axis of the tube, and EF, the tube containing
the lenses, which stands at right angles to
the position of the telescope, and slides into an
exterior tube, and the eye is applied at G. This
construction of the diagonal eye-piece may be
used with any eye-piece whatever, whether the
Huygenian or that of Ramsden. It will admit of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
any magnifying power, and if several different
eye-pieces be fitted to the sliding tube, they may
be changed at pleasure. This form of the diagonal
eye-piece, I therefore consider as the best and the
most convenient construction, although it is not
commonly adopted by opticians.</p>

<p>When any of these eye-pieces are applied to a
telescope, with the lens E on the upper part of it,
we look down upon the object, if it be a terrestrial
one, as if it were under our feet. If we turn the
eye-piece round in its socket a quarter of a circle
towards the left, an object directly before us in
the south, will appear as if it were in the <i>west</i> and
turned upside down. If, from this position, it is
turned round a semicircle towards the right, and
the eye applied, the same object will appear as if
it were situated in the east, and inverted; and if
it be turned round another quadrant, till it be
directly opposite to its first position, and the eye
applied from below, the object or landscape will
appear as if suspended in the atmosphere above
us. This eye-piece, therefore, is capable of exhibiting
objects in a great variety of aspects, and
the use of it is both pleasant and easy for the
observer. But there is a considerable loss of light,
occasioned by the reflection from the speculum,
which is sensibly felt when very high powers are
applied; and therefore when very small stars are
to be observed, such as some of those connected
with double or triple stars, the observer should
not study his own ease so much as the quantity of
light he can retain with a high power, which object
is best attained with an ordinary eye-piece
and a telescope of large aperture.</p>

<p>We have said that a diagonal eye-piece may be
constructed with a reflector <i>before</i> the eye-piece.
In this case, the speculum is sometimes made to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
slide before the eye at the requisite angle of
reclination, in which application each eye-piece
must necessarily have a groove to receive it, and
the eye must be applied without a hole to direct
it, but it may be put on and taken off without
disturbing the adjustment for distinct vision, and
is very simple in its application. But, on the
whole, the form represented in fig. 78, is the
most convenient, and should generally be preferred,
as any common astronomical eye-piece can be
applied to it. I have used a diagonal eye-piece
of this kind, with good effect, when a power of
180 has been applied to the sun and other celestial
objects.</p>

<p>Instead of a metallic speculum, a <i>rectangular
prism of glass</i> is sometimes substituted; for the
rays of light are then bent by reflection from the
second polished surface, which ought to be <i>dry</i>,
and undergo two refractions which achromatise
them; and the same effect is thus produced as by
polished metal. Ramsden sometimes gave one of
the polished faces of a right angled prism a curve,
which prism served instead of a lens in an eye-piece,
and also performed the office of a reflector.
A semi-globe, or what has been called a Bull’s
eye, has also been used as a diagonal eye-piece,
and when the curve is well-formed, and the glass
good, it is achromatic, and is said to perform
pretty well, but it is not superior to the forms
already described.</p>

<h4 id="TERRESTRIAL_EYE_PIECES">SECT. 2.&mdash;TERRESTRIAL EYE-PIECES.</h4>

<p>When describing the common refracting telescope,
(p. 228.) I have noticed that three eye-glasses,
placed at double their focal distances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
from each other, formerly constituted the terrestrial
eye-piece, as represented in fig. 47. But
this construction, especially for achromatic instruments,
has now become obsolete, and is never
used, except in small pocket spy-glasses formed
with a single object lens. In its place a four
glassed eye-piece has been substituted, which is
now universally used in all good telescopes, and
which, besides improving the vision and producing
an erect position of the images of objects, presents
a considerably larger field of view. During
the progressive stages of improvement made in
the construction of erect eye-pieces by Dollond
and Ramsden, three, four, and five lenses were
successively introduced; and hence, in some of
the old telescopes constructed by these artists, we
frequently find five lenses of different descriptions
composing the eye-piece. But four lenses,
arranged in the manner I am now about to describe,
have ultimately obtained the preference.
In a telescope having a celestial eye-piece of the
Huygenian form, the image that is formed in the
focus of the object glass, is that which is seen
magnified, and in an inverted position; but when a
four glassed eye-piece is used, which produces an
erect view of the object, the image is repeated,
and the <i>second</i> image, which is formed by the
inner pair of lenses AB on an enlarged scale, is
that which the pair of lenses CD at the eye-end
render visible on a scale still more enlarged. The
modern terrestrial eye-piece, represented in fig.
79, is, in fact, nothing else than a compound
microscope, consisting of an object lens, an amplifying
lens, and an eye-piece composed of a pair
of lenses on the principle of the Huygenian eye-piece.
Its properties will be best understood by
considering the first image of an object, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
formed in the focus of the object glass, as a small
luminous object to be rendered visible, in a magnified
state, by a compound microscope. The object
to be magnified may be considered as placed near
the point A, and the magnified image at <i>i</i>, which
is viewed by the lens D. Hence, if we look
through such an eye-piece at a small object placed
very near the lens A, we shall find that it acts as
a compound microscope of a moderate magnifying
power increasing, in some cases, the diameter
of the object about 10 times, and 100 times in
surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 79.</i></p>
<img id="fig079" src="images/fig079.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In order to distinguish the different lenses in
this eye-piece, we may call the lens A, which is
next to the first image, the <i>object-lens</i>, the next to
it B, the <i>amplifying-lens</i>, the third, or C, the
<i>field-lens</i>, and the one next the eye, D, the <i>eye-lens</i>.
The first image formed a little before A,
may be denominated the <i>radiant</i>, or the object
from which the rays proceed. Now, it is well
known as a principle in optics, that if the radiant
be brought nearer to the lens than its principal
focus, the emerging rays will <i>diverge</i>, and, on the
contrary, if the radiant be put farther from the
lens than its principal focal distance, the emerging
rays will <i>converge</i> to a point at a distance beyond
the lens, which will depend on the distance of the
radiant from the first face of the lens. In this
place an image of the radiant will be formed by
the concurrence of the converging rays, but in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
contrary position; and the length of the image
will exceed the length of the radiant in the same
proportion, as the distance of the image from the
radiant exceeds that of the radiant from the lens.
This secondary image of the radiant at <i>i</i>, is not
well-defined, when only one lens, as A, is used,
owing to the great spherical aberrations, and
therefore the amplifying lens is placed at the distance
of the shorter conjugate focus, with an intervening
diaphragm of a small diameter at the
place of the principal focus; the uses of which
lens and diaphragm are, first to cut off the coloured
rays that are occasioned by the dispersive property
of the object lens,&mdash;and secondly, to bring the
rays to a shorter conjugate focus for the place of
the image, than would have taken place with a
single lens having only one refraction. As the
secondary image is in this way much better defined
and free from colouration, the addition of
this second lens is a great improvement to vision.
For this reason I am clearly of opinion, that the
object glass of a compound microscope, instead of
consisting of a small single lens, should be formed
of two lenses on the principle now stated, which
would unquestionably add to the distinctness of
vision.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>the proportions of the focal
lengths of the lenses</i> in this four glass eye-piece,
Mr. Coddington states, that if the focal lengths,
reckoning from A to D, fig. 79, be as the numbers
3, 4, 4 and 3, and the distances between them on
the same scale, 4, 6, and 5, 2, the radii, reckoning
from the outer surface of A, should be thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir D. Brewster states, that a good achromatic
eye-piece may be made of 4 lenses, if their focal
lengths, reckoning from that next the object, be
as the numbers 14, 21, 27, 32; their distances
23, 44, 40; their apertures 5.6; 3.4; 13.5; 2.6;
and the aperture of the diaphragm placed in the
interior focus of the fourth eye-glass, 7. Another
proportion may be stated:&mdash;Suppose the lens next
the object A, to be 1⅞ inch focal length, then B
may be 2&frac12; inches, C 2 inches, and D 1&frac12;; and
their distances AB 2&frac12;; BC 3⅝; and CD 2⅜. In
one of Ramsden’s small telescopes, whose object
glass was 8&frac12; inches in focal length, and its magnifying
power 15.4, the focal lengths of the eye
glasses were A 0.775 of an inch, B 1.025, C 1.01,
D 0.79;&mdash;the distances AB 1.18, BC 1.83, and
CD 1.105. In the excellent achromatic telescope
of Dollond’s construction which belonged to the
Duc de Chaulnes, the focal lengths of the eye
glasses, beginning with that next the object, were
14&frac14; lines, 19, 22&frac34;, 14; their distances 22.48 lines,
46.17, 21.45, and their thickness at the centre,
1.23 lines, 1.25, 1.47. The fourth lens was
plano-convex, with the plane side to the eye, and
the rest were double convex lenses. This telescope
was in focal length 3 feet 5&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>The magnifying power of this eye-piece, as
usually made, differs only in a small degree from
what would be produced by using the first or the
fourth glass alone, in which case the magnifying
power would be somewhat greater, but the vision
less distinct, and were the lens next the eye used
alone without the field glass, the field of view
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
would be much contracted. Stops should be
placed between the lenses A and B, near to B, and
a larger one between C and D, to prevent any
false light from passing through the lenses to the
eye. The more stops that are introduced into a
telescope&mdash;which should all be blackened&mdash;provided
they do not hinder the pencils of light proceeding
from the object, the better will the instrument
perform.</p>

<p>For the information of amateur constructors of
telescopes, I shall here state the dimensions of
two or three four glassed eye-pieces in my possession,
which perform with great distinctness, and
present a pretty large field of view. In one of
these, adapted to a 44&frac12; inch achromatic, the lens
A, next the object, is 1⅞ inch, focal length, and
about 1 inch diameter, with the plane side, next
the object. The focal length of the lens B 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
inches, diameter <sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch, with its plane side next
A; distance of these lenses from each other
2<sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches. Distance of the field lens C from the
lens B 5&frac12; inches. The small hole or diaphragm
between A and B is at the focus of A, and is
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> inch diameter, and about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch from
the lens B. The field lens C is 2 inches focal
length, and 1&frac14; inch diameter, with its plane side
next the eye. The lens next the eye D is 1 inch
focal distance, &frac12; inch diameter, and is distant from
the field glass 1&frac34; inch, with its plane side next
the eye. The magnifying power of this eye-piece
is equivalent to that of a single lens whose focal
length is half an inch, and with the 44&frac12; inch object
glass produces a power of about 90 times.
The lens next the eye can be changed for another
1⅜ inch focal length, which produces a power of
65; and the two glasses CD can be changed for
another set, of a longer focal distance which produces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
a power of 45 times. The whole length of
this eye-piece is 11&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>In another eye-piece, adapted to a pocket achromatic,
whose object glass is 9 inches focal length,
the lens A is 1 inch focal length, and &frac12; inch diameter;
the lens B 1&frac14; inch, and &frac12; inch diameter,
their distance 1&frac12; inch, the lens C 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch focal
length, and <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch diameter; the eye-lens D <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch
focal length, and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch diameter; distance between
C and D 1⅛ inch. The distance between B
and C 1&frac34; inch. The whole length of this eye-piece
is 4&frac12; inches, and its power is nearly equal to
that of a single lens of &frac12; or <sup>6</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of an inch focal
length, the magnifying power of the telescope being
about 16 times. Another eye-piece of much
larger dimensions, has the lens A of 2&frac12; inches
focal length, and &frac34; inch diameter: the lens B 2&frac34;
inches focus and <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch diameter; and their distance
2&frac34; inches; the lens C 2⅝ inches focus and
1⅛ inch diameter; the lens D 1&frac34; inch focus
and &frac34; inch diameter; distance from each other
2&frac34; inches. The distance between the lenses B
and C is 4 inches. The magnifying power is equal
to that of a single lens 1⅛ inch focal distance.
When applied to an achromatic object glass 6 feet
7 inches focal length, it produces a power of about
70 times. This eye-piece has a moveable tube 9
inches in length in which the two lenses next the
eye are contained, by pulling out which, and consequently
increasing the distance between the
lenses B and C, the magnifying power may be
increased to 100, 120 or 140, according to the
distance to which this moveable tube is drawn
out. It has also a second and third set of lenses,
corresponding to C and D of a shorter focal distance,
which produce higher magnifying powers on
a principle to be afterwards explained.

<h4 id="DESCRIPTION_OF_AN_EYE_PIECE"><i>Description of an eye-piece, &amp;c. of an old Dutch
Achromatic Telescope.</i></h4>

<p>About twenty or thirty years ago, I purchased,
in an optician’s shop in Edinburgh, a small achromatic
telescope, made in Amsterdam, which was
supposed, by the optician, to have been constructed
prior to the invention of achromatic telescopes by
Mr. Dollond. It is mounted wholly of brass, and
in all its parts is a piece of beautiful and exquisite
workmanship, and the utmost care seems to
have been taken to have all the glasses and diaphragms
accurately adjusted. The object glass is
a double achromatic, 6&frac12; inches focal distance and
1 inch diameter, but the clear aperture is only <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>
inch diameter. It is perfectly achromatic, and
would bear a power of 50 times, if it had
a sufficient quantity of light. The following inscription
is engraved on the tube adjacent to the
object glass:&mdash;“<i>Jan van Deyl en Zoon Invenit et
Fecit, Amsterdam, Ao. 1769</i>.” Although Dollond
exhibited the principle of an achromatic
telescope, eight or ten years before the date here
specified, yet it is not improbable that the artist
whose name is here stated, may not have heard of
Dollond’s invention; and that he was really, as he
assumes, one of the inventors of the achromatic
telescope. For, the invention of this telescope by
Dollond was not very generally known, except
among philosophers and the London opticians, till
a number of years after the date above stated.
Euler, in his “Letters to a German Princess”&mdash;in
which telescopes are particularly described, makes
no mention of, nor the least allusion to the invention
of Dollond, though this was a subject which particularly
engaged his attention. Now, these letters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
were written in 1762, but were not published till
1770. When alluding to the defects in telescopes
arising from the different refrangibility of the rays
of light, in Letter 43, and that they might possibly
be rectified by means of different transparent
substances, he says, ‘But neither theory nor
practice have hitherto been carried to the degree
of perfection necessary to the execution of a
structure which should remedy these defects.’ Mr.
B. Martin, in his ‘Gentleman and Lady’s Philosophy,’
published in 1781, alludes to the achromatic
telescope, but speaks of it as it were but
very little, if at all superior to the common refracting
telescope. And therefore, I think it
highly probable that Jan van Deyl, was really
an inventor of an achromatic telescope, before
he had any notice of what Dollond and others
had done in this way some short time before.</p>

<p>But my principal object in adverting to this
telescope, is to describe the structure of the eye-piece,
which is a very fine one, and which is somewhat
different from the achromatic eye-piece
above described. It consists of four glasses, two
combined next the eye, and two next the object.
Each of these combinations forms an astronomical
eye-piece nearly similar to the Huygenian. The
lens A, next the object, fig. 80, is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch focal
distance, and <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch diameter; the lens B <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch
focus, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> inch diameter, and the distance between
them somewhat less than <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch; the
diameter of the aperture <i>e</i> about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>15</sub> of an inch.
This combination forms an excellent astronomical
eye-piece, with a large flat field, and its magnifying
power is equivalent to that of a single lens <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>
or <sup>6</sup>/<sub>8</sub> focal length. The lens C is &frac12; inch focal
length, and <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch diameter; the lens D &frac14; inch
focus, and about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> inch diameter; their distance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
about &frac12; inch, or a small fraction
more. The hole at <i>d</i> is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>
or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub> of an inch diameter, and the
distance between the lenses B
and C about 1&frac12; inch. The whole
length of the eye-piece is 3&frac14;
inches&mdash;exactly the same size as
represented in the engraving.
Its magnifying power is equal to
that of a single lens &frac14; inch focal
length; and consequently the
telescope, though only 9&frac12; inches
long, magnifies 26 times, with
great distinctness, though there
is a little deficiency of light when
viewing land objects, which are
not well illuminated.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 80.</i></p>
<img id="fig080" src="images/fig080.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The glasses of this telescope
are all plano-convex, with their
convex-sides towards the object&mdash;except
the lens D, which is
double convex, but flattest on the
side next the eye, and they are all
very accurately finished. The two
lenses C and D form an astronomical
eye-piece nearly similar to
that formed by the lenses A and B. The focus of
the telescope is adjusted by a screw, the threads of
which are formed upon the outside of a tube into
which the eye-piece slides. The eye-piece and
apparatus connected with it, is screwed into the
inside of the main tube, when not in use, when
the instrument forms a compact brass cylinder 6
inches long, which is enclosed in a fish-skin case,
lined with silk velvet, which opens with hinges.</p>

<p>The lenses in the eye-pieces formerly described,
though stated to be plano-convexes, are for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
most part <i>crossed glasses</i>, that is ground on tools
of a long focus on the one side, and to a short
focus on the other. The construction of the eye-piece
of the Dutch telescope above described, is
one which might be adopted with a good effect in
most of our achromatic telescopes; and I am persuaded,
from the application I have made of it to
various telescopes, that it is even superior, in distinctness
and accuracy, and in the <i>flatness of field</i>
which it produces to the eye-piece in common use.
The two astronomical eye-pieces of which it consists,
when applied to large achromatic telescopes,
perform with great accuracy, and are excellently
adapted for celestial observations.</p>

<h4 id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PANCRATIC_EYE_TUBE">SECT. 3.&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF THE PANCRATIC
EYE-TUBE.</h4>

<p>From what we have stated, when describing the
common terrestrial eye-piece now applied to achromatic
instruments, (p. 349, fig. 79.), it appears
obvious, that any variety of magnifying powers,
within certain limits, may be obtained by removing
the set of lenses CD, fig. 79, nearer to or farther
from the tube which contains the lenses A and B,
on the same principle as the magnifying power of
a compound microscope is increased by removing
the eye-glasses to a greater distance from the
object-lens. If then, the pair of eye-lenses CD
be attached to an inner tube that will draw out
and increase their distance from the inner pair of
lenses, as the tube <i>a b c d</i>, the magnifying power
may be indefinitely increased or diminished, by
pushing in or drawing out the sliding tube, and
a scale might be placed on this tube, which,
if divided into equal intervals, will be a scale of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
magnifying powers, by which the power of the
telescope will be seen at every division, when the
lowest power is once determined.</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster, in his ‘Treatise on New
Philosophical instruments,’ Book i. chap. vii.
page 59, published in 1813, has adverted to this
circumstance, in his description of an ‘Eye-piece
wire micrometer,’ and complains of Mr. Ezekiel
Walker, having in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’
for August, 1811, described such an instrument
as an invention of his own. Dr. Kitchener some
years afterwards, described what he called a Pancratic
or omnipotent eye-piece, and got one made
by Dollond, with a few modifications different from
that suggested by Brewster and Walker, which
were little else than cutting the single tube into
several parts, and giving it the <i>appearance</i> of a
new invention. In fact, none of these gentlemen
had a right to claim it as his peculiar invention, as
the principle was known and recognised long before.
I had increased the magnifying powers of
telescopes, on the same principle, several years
before any of these gentlemen communicated their
views on the subject, although I never formally
constructed a scale of powers. Mr. B. Martin,
who died in 1782, proposed many years before,
such a moveable interior tube as that alluded to,
for varying the magnifying power.</p>

<p>In order to give the reader a more specific idea
of this contrivance, I shall present him with a
figure and description of one of Dr. Kitchener’s
Pancratic eye-pieces, copied from one lately in my
possession. The following are the exact dimensions
of this instrument, with the focal distances,
&amp;c. of the glasses, &amp;c. of which it is composed.

<p>From the figure and description, the reader will
be at no loss to perceive how the magnifying
power is ascertained by this eye-piece. If the
lowest power for a 44 inch telescope be found to
be 100, when the three sliding tubes are shut into
the larger one, then by drawing out the tube next
the eye 4 divisions, a power of 140 is produced;
by drawing out the tube next the eye its whole
length, and the second tube to the division marked
220, a power of 220 times is produced, and drawing
out all the tubes to their utmost extent, as
represented in the figure, a power of 400 is obtained.
These powers are by far too high for
such a telescope, as the powers between 300 and
400 can seldom or never be used. Were the scale
to begin at 50, and terminate at 200, it would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
much better adapted to a 3&frac12; feet telescope. Each
alteration of the magnifying power requires a
new adjustment of the eye-piece for distinct
vision. As the magnifying power is increased,
the distance between the eye-glass and the object-glass
must be diminished. Dr. Kitchener says,
that ‘the pancratic eye tube gives a better defined
image of a fixed star, and shows double stars decidedly
more distinct and perfectly separated than
any other eye tube, and that such tubes will probably
enable us to determine the distances of
these objects from each other, in a more perfect
manner than has been possible heretofore.’
These tubes are made by Dollond, London, and
are sold for two guineas each. But I do not
think they excel, in distinctness, those which
are occasionally made by Mr. Tulley and other
opticians.

<h4 id="MISCELLANEOUS_REMARKS_IN_RELATION_TO_TELESCOPES">MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS IN RELATION TO TELESCOPES.</h4>

<p>The following remarks, chiefly in regard to the
manner of using telescopes, may perhaps be useful
to young observers, who are not much accustomed
to the mode of managing these instruments.</p>

<p>1. <i>Adjustments requisite to be attended to in the
use of telescopes.</i> When near objects are viewed
with a considerable magnifying power, the eye-tube
requires to be removed farther from the
object-glass than when very distant objects are
contemplated. When the telescope is adjusted
for an object, 6, 8, or 10 miles distant, a very
considerable alteration in the adjustment is requisite
in order to see distinctly an object at the distance
of two or three hundred yards, especially if
the instrument is furnished with a high magnifying
power. In this last case, the eye-tube requires
to be drawn out to a considerable distance beyond
the focus for parallel rays. I have found that, in
a telescope which magnifies 70 times, when
adjusted for an object at the distance of two
miles, the adjustment requires to be altered fully
one inch in order to perceive distinctly an object
at the distance of two or three hundred yards;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
that is, the tube must be drawn, in this case, an
inch farther from the object-glass, and pushed in
the same extent, when we wish to view an object
at the distance of two or three miles. These
adjustments are made, in pocket perspectives, by
gently sliding the eye-tube in or out, by giving it
a gentle circular or spiral motion till the object
appear distinct. In using telescopes which are
held in the hand, the best plan is to draw all the
tubes out to their full length, and then, looking at
the object, with the left hand supporting the main
tube near the object-glass, and the right supporting
the eye-tube&mdash;gently and gradually push in
the eye-piece till distinct vision be obtained. In
Gregorian reflecting telescopes this adjustment is
made by means of a screw connected with the
small speculum; and in large achromatics, by
means of a rack and pinion connected with the
eye-tube. When the magnifying power of a
telescope is comparatively small, the eye-tube
requires to be altered only a very little.</p>

<p>There is another adjustment requisite to be
attended to, in order to adapt the telescope to the
eyes of different persons. Those whose eyes are
too convex, or who are short-sighted, require the
eye-tube to be pushed in, and those whose eyes are
somewhat flattened, as old people, require the tube
to be drawn out. Indeed there are scarcely two
persons whose eyes do not require different adjustments
in a slight degree. In some cases I have
found that the difference of adjustment for two
individuals, in order to produce distinct vision in
each, amounted to nearly half an inch. Hence
the difficulty of exhibiting the sun, moon, and
planets through telescopes, and even terrestrial
objects, to a company of persons who are unacquainted
with the mode of using or adjusting such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
instruments&mdash;not one half of whom generally see
the object distinctly&mdash;for, upon the proper adjustment
of a telescope to the eye, the accuracy of
vision, in all cases, depends; and no one except
the individual actually looking through the instrument,
can be certain that it is accurately adjusted
to his eye, and even the individual himself, from
not being accustomed to the view of certain objects,
may be uncertain whether or not the adjustment
be correct. I have found by experience
that when the magnifying powers are high, as 150
or 200, the difference of adjustment required for
different eyes is very slight; but when low powers
are used, as 20, 30, or 40, the difference of the
requisite adjustments is sometimes very considerable,
amounting to &frac14; or &frac12; of an inch.</p>

<p>2. <i>State of the Atmosphere most proper for
observing terrestrial and celestial objects.</i> The
atmosphere which is thrown around the globe&mdash;while
it is essentially requisite to the physical
constitution of our world, and the comfort of its
inhabitants&mdash;is found in many instances a serious
obstruction to the accurate performance of telescopes.
Sometimes it is obscured by mists and
exhalations, sometimes it is thrown into violent
undulations by the heat of the sun and the process
of evaporation, and even, in certain cases, where
there appears a pure unclouded azure, there is an
agitation among its particles and the substances
incorporated with them, which prevents the telescope
from producing distinct vision either of terrestrial
or celestial objects. For viewing distant
terrestrial objects, especially with high powers, the
best time is early in the morning, a little after sun-rise,
and, from that period till about 9 o’clock
A.M., in summer; and, in the evening about two
or three hours before sun-set. From about 10
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
o’clock <small>A.M.</small> till 4 or 5 in the afternoon, in summer,
if the sky be clear and the sun shining, there is
generally a considerable undulation in the atmosphere,
occasioned by the solar rays and the rapid
evaporation, which prevents high powers from
being used with distinctness on any telescope,
however excellent. The objects at such times,
when powers of 50, 70, or 100 are applied, appear
to undulate like the waves of the sea, and, notwithstanding
every effort to adjust the telescope,
they appear confused and indistinct. Even with
very moderate magnifying powers this imperfection
is perceptible. In such circumstances, I
have sometimes used a power of 200 times on
distant land objects, with good effect, a little before
sun-set, when, in the forenoon of the same day, I
could not have applied a power of 50 with any
degree of distinctness. On days when the air is
clear, and the atmosphere covered with clouds,
terrestrial objects may be viewed with considerably
high powers. When there has been a long-continued
drought, the atmosphere is then in a very
unfit state for enjoying distinct vision with high
magnifying powers, on account of the quantity of
vapours with which the atmosphere is then surcharged,
and the undulations they produce. But,
after copious showers of rain, especially if accompanied
with high winds, the air is purified, and
distant objects appear with greater brilliancy and
distinctness than at any other seasons. In using
telescopes, the objects at which we look should, if
possible, be nearly in a direction opposite to that of
the sun. When they are viewed nearly in the
direction of the sun, their shadows are turned
towards us, and they consequently appear dim and
obscure. By not attending to this circumstance,
some persons, in trying telescopes, have pronounced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
a good instrument to be imperfect, which,
had it been tried on objects properly illuminated,
would have been found to be excellent. In our
variable northerly climate the atmosphere is not
so clear and serene for telescopic observation as in
Italy, the South of France, and in many of the
countries which lie within the tropics. The undulations
of the air, owing to the causes alluded
to above, constitute one of the principal reasons
why a telescope magnifying above a hundred
times can seldom be used with any good effect in
viewing terrestrial objects&mdash;though I have sometimes
used a power of nearly 200 with considerable
distinctness, in the stillness of a summer or
autumnal evening, when the rays of the declining
sun strongly illuminated distant objects.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is likewise frequently a great
obstruction to the distinct perception of <i>celestial</i>
objects. It is scarcely possible for one who has
not been accustomed to astronomical observations,
to form a conception of the very great difference
there is in the appearance of some of the heavenly
bodies in different states of the atmosphere.
There are certain conditions of the atmosphere
essentially requisite for making accurate observations
with powerful telescopes, and it is but seldom,
especially in our climate, that all the favourable
circumstances concur. The nights must be very
clear and serene&mdash;the moon absent&mdash;no twilight&mdash;no
haziness&mdash;no violent wind&mdash;no sudden change
of temperature, as from thaw to frost&mdash;and no
surcharge of the atmosphere with aqueous
vapour. I have frequently found that, on the
first and second nights after a thaw, when a
strong frost had set in, and when the heavens
appeared very brilliant, and the stars vivid
and sparkling&mdash;the planets, when viewed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
high powers, appeared remarkably undefined and
indistinct; their margins appeared waving and
jagged, and the belts of Jupiter, which at other
times were remarkably distinct, were so obscured
and ill-defined, that they could with difficulty be
traced. This is probably owing to the quantity
of aqueous vapour, and perhaps icy particles, then
floating in the air, and to the undulations thereby
produced. When a hard frost has continued a
considerable time, this impediment to distinct
observation is in a great measure removed. But
I have never enjoyed more accurate and distinct
views of the heavenly bodies than in fresh serene
evenings, when there was no frost and no wind,
and only a few fleecy clouds occasionally hovering
around. On such evenings, and on such alone,
the highest powers may be applied. I have used
magnifying powers on such occasions with good
effect, which could not have been applied, so as to
ensure distinct vision, more frequently than two or
three days in the course of a year.</p>

<p>Sir William Herschel has observed, in reference
to this point, ‘In beautiful nights, when the outside
of our telescopes is dropping with moisture,
discharged from the atmosphere, there are now
and then favourable <i>hours</i> in which it is hardly
possible to put a limit to the magnifying powers.
But such valuable opportunities are extremely
scarce, and with large instruments it will always
be lost labour to observe at other times. In order
therefore, to calculate how long a time it must
take to sweep the heavens, as far as they are
within the reach of my forty-feet telescope,
charged with a magnifying power of 1000, I
have had recourse to my journals to find how
many favourable hours we may annually hope for
in this climate. And, under all favourable circumstances,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
it appears, that a year which will
afford ninety, or at most, one hundred <i>hours</i> is to
be called very productive.’ ‘In the equator,
with my twenty feet telescope, I have swept over
zones of two degrees with a power of 157, but an
allowance of ten minutes in Polar distance must
be made for lapping the sweeps over one another
where they join. As the breadth of the zones
may be increased towards the poles, the northern
hemisphere may be swept in about 40 zones; to
these we must add 19 southern zones; then 59
zones which, on account of the sweeps lapping
over one another, about 5 minutes of time in
right ascension, we must reckon of 25 hours each,
will give 1475 hours. And allowing 100 hours
per year, we find that with the 20 feet telescope,
the heavens may be swept in about 14 years and
three quarters. Now the time of sweeping with
different magnifying powers will be as the squares
of the powers; and putting <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> for the power
and time in the 20 feet telescope, and P = 1000
for the power in the 40 feet instrument, we shall
have p<sup>2</sup> : t :: P<sup>2</sup> : <sup>tP2</sup>/<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub> = 59840. Then making
the same allowance for 100 hours per year, it
appears that it will require not less than 598
years, to look with the 40 feet reflector, charged
with the above-mentioned power, only one single
moment into each point of space; and even then,
so much of the southern hemisphere will remain
unexplored, as will take up 213 years more to
examine.’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>From the above remarks of so eminent an
observer, the reader will perceive how difficult it
is to explore the heavens with minuteness and
accuracy, and with how many disappointments,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
arising from the state of the atmosphere, the
astronomer must lay his account, when employed
in planetary or sidereal investigation. Besides the
circumstances now stated, it ought to be noticed
that a star or a planet is only in a situation for a
high magnifying power, about half the time it is
above the horizon. The density of the atmosphere,
and the quantity of vapours with which it
is charged near the horizon, prevent distinct vision
of celestial objects with high powers, till they have
risen to at least 15 or 20 degrees in altitude, and
the highest magnifiers can scarcely be applied
with good effect, unless the object is near the
meridian, and at a considerable elevation above
the horizon. If the moon be viewed a little after
her rising, and afterwards when she comes to her
highest elevation in autumn, the difference in her
appearance and distinctness will be strikingly perceptible.
It is impossible to guess whether a
night be well adapted for celestial observations, till
we actually make the experiment, and instruments
are frequently condemned, when tried at
improper seasons, when the atmosphere only is in
fault. A certain observer remarks,&mdash;‘I have
never seen the face of Saturn more distinctly
than in a night when the air has been so hazy,
that with my naked eye, I could hardly discern a
star of less than the third magnitude.’ The
degree of the transparency of the air is likewise
varying almost in the course of every minute, so that
even in the course of the same half hour, planets
and stars will appear perfectly defined, and the
reverse. The vapours moving and undulating the
atmosphere, even when the sky appears clear to
the naked eye, will in a few instants destroy the
distinctness of vision, and in a few seconds more,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
the object will resume its clear and well-defined
aspect.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>3. <i>On the magnifying powers requisite for
observing the phenomena of the different planets&mdash;comets&mdash;double
stars, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There are some objects connected with astronomy
which cannot be perceived without having
recourse to instruments and to powers of great
magnitude. But it is a vulgar error to imagine
that very large and very expensive telescopes
are absolutely necessary for viewing the greater
part of the more interesting scenery of the heavens.
Most of the phenomena of the planets, comets
and double stars and other objects, are visible
with instruments of moderate dimensions, so that
every one who has a relish for celestial investigations,
may, at a comparatively small expense,
procure a telescope, for occasional observations,
which will show the principal objects and phenomena
described in books on astronomy. Many
persons have been misled by some occasional
remarks which Sir W. Herschel made, in reference
to certain very high powers which he sometimes
put, by way of experiment, on some of his telescopes,
as if these were the powers requisite for
viewing the objects to which he refers. For
example, it is stated that he once put a power of
6450 times on his 7 feet Newtonian telescope of
6<sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches aperture; but this was only for the
purpose of an experiment, and could be of no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
use whatever when applied to the moon, the
planets and most objects in the heavens. Herschel,
through the whole course of his writings, mentions
his only having used it <i>twice</i>, namely on
the stars α Lyr&aelig;, and γ Leonis, which stars
can be seen more distinctly and sharply defined
with a power of 420. To produce a power of
6450 on such a telescope, would require a lens of
only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>77</sub>th of an inch in focal distance, and it is
questioned by some whether Herschel had lenses
of so small a size in his possession, or whether it
is possible to form them with accuracy.</p>

<p><i>Powers requisite for observing the phenomena of
the planets.</i>&mdash;The planet Mercury requires a considerable
magnifying power, in order to perceive
its phases with distinctness. I have seldom viewed
this planet with a less power than 100 and 150,
with which powers its half moon, its gibbous, and
its crescent phase, may be distinctly perceived.
With a power of 40, 50, or even 60 times, these
phases can with difficulty be seen, especially as it is
generally at a low altitude, when such observations
are made. The phases of <i>Venus</i> are much more
easily distinguished, especially the <i>crescent</i> phase,
which is seen to the greatest advantage about a
month before and after the inferior conjunction.
With a power not exceeding 25 or 30 times, this
phase, at such periods, may be easily perceived. It
requires, however, much higher powers to perceive
distinctly the variations of the gibbous phase; and if
this planet be not viewed at a considerably high
altitude when in a half-moon or gibbous phase,
the obscurity and undulations of the atmosphere
near the horizon, prevent such phases from being
accurately distinguished, even when high powers
are applied. Although certain phenomena of the
planets may be seen with such low powers as I
have now stated, yet, in every instance, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
highest magnifying powers, consistent with distinctness,
should be preferred, as the eye is not
then strained, and the object appears with a
greater degree of magnitude and splendour. The
planet <i>Mars</i> requires a considerable degree of
magnifying power, even when at its nearest distance
from the earth, in order to discern its spots
and its gibbous phase. I have never obtained a
satisfactory view of the spots which mark the
surface, and their relative position, with a less
power than 130, 160, or 200 times; and even
with such powers, persons not much accustomed
to look through telescopes, find a difficulty in distinguishing
them.</p>

<p>The strongest and most prominent <i>belts of
Jupiter</i>, may be seen with a power of about 45;
which power may be put upon a 20-inch achromatic,
or a 1 foot reflector. But a satisfactory
view of all the belts, and the relative positions
they occupy, cannot be obtained with much lower
powers than 80, 100, or 140. The most common
positions of these belts are&mdash;one dark and well-defined
belt to the south of Jupiter’s equator;
another of nearly the same description to the
north of it, and one about his north and his south
polar circles. These polar belts are much more
faint, and consequently not so easily distinguished
as the equatorial belts. The <i>moons</i> of this planet,
in a very clear night, may sometimes be seen with
a pocket 1 foot achromatic glass, magnifying about
15 or 16 times. Some people have pretended
that they could see some of these satellites with
their naked eye; but this is very doubtful, and it
is probable that such persons mistook certain
fixed stars which happened to be near Jupiter for
his satellites. But, in order to have a clear and
interesting view of these, powers of at least 80 or
100 times should be used. In order to perceive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
their immersions into the shadow of Jupiter, and
the exact moment of their emersions from it, a
telescope not less than a 44 inch achromatic, with
a power of 150 should be employed. When these
satellites are viewed through large telescopes with
high magnifying powers, they appear with well
defined disks, like small planets. The planet
Jupiter has generally been considered as a good
test by which to try telescopes for celestial purposes.
When it is near the meridian and at a
high altitude, if its general surface, its belts, and
its margin appear distinct and well-defined, it
forms a strong presumptive evidence that the
instrument is a good one.</p>

<p>The planet <i>Saturn</i> forms one of the most
interesting objects for telescopic observation. The
<i>ring</i> of Saturn may be <i>seen</i> with a power of 45;
but it can only be contemplated with advantage
when powers of 100, 150, and 200 are applied to
a 3 or a 5 feet achromatic. The <i>belts of Saturn</i>
are not to be seen distinctly with an achromatic
of less than 2&frac34; inches aperture, or a Gregorian
reflector of less than 4 inches aperture, nor with a
less magnifying power than 100 times. Sir W.
Herschel has drawn this planet with five belts
across its disk; but it is seldom that above one or
two of them can be seen by moderate-sized telescopes
and common observers. The <i>division</i> of
the double ring, when the planet is in a favorable
position for observation, and in a high altitude,
may sometimes be perceived with a 44-inch
achromatic, with an aperture of 2&frac34; inches, and
with powers of 150 or 180, but higher powers
and larger instruments are generally requisite to
perceive this phenomenon distinctly; and even
when a portion of it is seen at the extremities of
the <i>ans&aelig;</i>, the division cannot, in every case, be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
traced along the whole of the half-circumference
of the ring which is presented to our eye. Mr.
Hadley’s engraving of Saturn, in the ‘Philosophical
Transactions’ for 1723, though taken with a
Newtonian reflector with a power of 228, represents
the division of the ring as seen only on the
ans&aelig; or extremities of the elliptic figure in which
the ring appears. The best period for observing
this division is when the ring appears at its utmost
width. In this position it was seen in 1840, and
it will appear nearly in the same position in 1855.
When the ring appears like a very narrow ellipse,
a short time previous to its disappearance, the
division, or dark space between the rings, cannot
be seen by ordinary instruments.</p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel very properly observes, ‘There
is not perhaps another object in the heavens that
presents us with such a variety of extraordinary
phenomena as the planet Saturn; a magnificent
globe, encompassed by a stupendous double ring;
attended by seven satellites; ornamented with
equatorial belts; compressed at the poles; turning
upon its axis; mutually eclipsing its ring and
satellites, and eclipsed by them; the most distant
of the rings also turning upon its axis, and the
same taking place with the farthest of the satellites;
all the parts of the system of Saturn occasionally
reflecting light on each other; the rings
and moons illuminating the nights of the Saturnian,
the globe and satellites enlightening the dark parts
of the ring; and the planet and rings throwing
back the sun’s beams upon the moons, when they
are deprived of them at the time of their conjunctions.’
This illustrious astronomer states, that
with a new 7 feet mirror of extraordinary distinctness
he examined this planet, and found that the
ring reflects more light than the body, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
a power of 570 the colour of the body becomes
yellowish, while that of the ring remains more
white. On March 11, 1780, he tried the powers
of 222, 332, and 440 successively, and found the
light of Saturn less intense than that of the ring;
the colour of the body turning, with the high
powers, to a kind of yellow white, while that of the
ring still remained white.</p>

<p>Most of the <i>satellites</i> of Saturn are difficult to
be perceived with ordinary telescopes, excepting
the 4th, which may be seen with powers of from
60 to 100 times. It was discovered by Huygens
in 1655, by means of a common refracting telescope
12 feet long, which might magnify about 70
times. The next in brightness to this is the 5th
satellite, which Cassini discovered in 1671, by
means of a 17 feet refractor, which might carry a
power of above 80 times. The 3rd was discovered
by the same astronomer in 1672, by a longer
telescope; and the 1st and 2nd, in 1684, by
means of two excellent object-glasses of 100 and
136 feet, which might have magnified from 200 to
230 times. They were afterwards seen by two
other glasses of 70 and 90 feet, made by Campani,
and sent from Rome to the Royal Observatory at
Paris, by the King’s order, after the discovery of
the 3rd and 5th satellites. It is asserted, however,
that all those 5 satellites were afterwards
seen with a telescope of 34 feet, with an aperture
of 3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches, which would magnify about 120
times. These satellites, on the whole, except the
4th and 5th, are not easily detected. Dr. Derham,
who frequently viewed Saturn through Huygens’
glass of 126 feet focal length, declares, in the
preface to his ‘Astro-Theology,’ that he could
never perceive above 3 of the satellites. Sir W.
Herschel observes, that the visibility of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
minute and extremely faint objects, depends more
on the <i>penetrating</i> than upon the <i>magnifying</i>
power of our telescopes; and that with a 10 feet
Newtonian, charged with a magnifying power of
only 60, he saw all the 5 old satellites; but the
6th and 7th, which were discovered and were
easily seen with his 40-feet telescope, and were
also visible in his 20-feet instrument, were not
discernible in the 7 or the 10-feet telescopes,
though all that <i>magnifying power</i> can do may be
done as well with the 7-feet as with any larger instrument.
Speaking of the 7th satellite, he says,
‘Even in my 40-feet reflector it appears no bigger
than a very small lucid point. I see it, however,
very well in the 20-feet reflector; to which the
exquisite figure of the speculum not a little contributes.’
A late observer asserts, that in 1825,
with a 12-feet achromatic, of 7 inches aperture,
made by Tulley, with a power of 150, the 7
satellites were easily visible, but not so easily
with a power of 200; and that the planet appeared
as bright as brilliantly burnished silver, and the
division in the ring and a belt were very plainly
distinguished, with a power of 200.</p>

<p>The planet <i>Uranus</i>, being generally invisible to
the naked eye, is seldom an object of attention
to common observers. A considerable magnifying
power is requisite to make it appear in a planetary
form with a well-defined disk. The best
periods for detecting it are, when it is near its
opposition to the sun, or when it happens to
approximate to any of the other planets, or to a
well-known fixed star. When none of these circumstances
occur, its position requires to be
pointed out by an Equatorial Telescope. On the
morning of the 25th January, 1841, this planet
happened to be in conjunction with Venus, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
which time it was only 4 minutes north of that
planet. Several days before this conjunction, I
made observations on Uranus. On the evening of
the 24th, about 8 hours before the conjunction,
the two planets appeared in the same field of the
telescope, the one exceedingly splendid, and the
other more obscure, but distinct and well-defined.
Uranus could not be perceived, either with the
naked eye, or with an opera glass; but could be
distinguished as a very small star by means of a
pocket achromatic telescope magnifying about 14
times. It is questionable whether, under the
most favourable circumstances, this planet can
ever be distinguished by the naked eye. With
magnifying powers of 30 and 70, it appeared as
a moderately large star with a steady light, but
without any sensible disk. With powers of 120,
180, and 250, it presented a round and pretty
well-defined disk, but not so luminous and distinct
as it would have done in a higher altitude.</p>

<p>The <i>Double Stars</i> require a great <i>variety</i> of
powers, in order to distinguish the small stars that
accompany the larger. Some of them are distinguished
with moderate powers, while others require
pretty large instruments, furnished with high
magnifying eye-pieces. I shall therefore select
only a few as a specimen. The star <i>Castor</i>, or
α Geminorum, may be easily seen to be double
with powers of from 70 to 100. I have sometimes
seen these stars, which are nearly equal in size
and colour, with a terrestrial power of 44 on a
44-inch achromatic. The appearance of this star
with such powers is somewhat similar to that
of η Coron&aelig; in a 7 feet achromatic, of 5 inches
aperture, with a power of 500. γ Andromed&aelig;
may be seen with a moderate power. In a 30-inch
achromatic of 2 inches aperture, and a power
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
of 80, it appears like ε Bootis, when seen in a 5-feet
achromatic, with a power of 460. This star
is said to be visible even in a 1-foot achromatic
with a power of 35. ε <i>Lyr&aelig;</i>, which is a quintuple
star, but appears to the naked eye as a single
star,&mdash;may be seen to be double with a power of
from 6 to 12 time. γ <i>Leonis</i> is visible in a 44-inch
achromatic, with a power of 180 or 200.
<i>Rigel</i> in a 3&frac12;-feet achromatic, may be seen with
powers varying from 130 to 200. The small star,
however, which accompanies Rigel, is sometimes
difficult to be perceived, even with such powers.
ε <i>Bootis</i> is seldom distinctly defined with an achromatic
of less aperture than 3&frac14; inches, or a reflector
of less than 5 inches, with a power of at
least 250.</p>

<p>These and similar stars are not to be expected
to be seen equally well at all times, even when
the magnifying and illuminating powers are properly
proportioned; as much depends upon the
state of the weather, and the pureness of the
atmosphere. In order to perceive the closest of
the double stars, Sir W. Herschel recommends,
that the power of the telescope should be adjusted
upon a star known to be single, of nearly the
same altitude, magnitude, and colour with the
double star which is to be observed, or upon one
star above and another below it. Thus, the late
Mr. Aubert, the astronomer, could not see the two
stars of γ Leonis, when the focus was adjusted
upon that star itself; but he soon observed the
small star, after he had adjusted the focus upon
Regulus. An exact adjustment of the focus of
the instrument is indispensably requisite, in order
to perceive such minute objects.</p>

<p>In viewing the <i>Nebul&aelig;</i>, and the very small and
immensely distant fixed stars, which require much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
light to render them visible, a large aperture of
the object-glass or speculum, which admits of a
great quantity of light, is of more importance
than high magnifying powers. It is light chiefly,
accompanied with a moderate magnifying power,
that enables us to <i>penetrate</i> into the distant regions
of space. Sir W. Herschel, when sweeping the
profundities of the Milky way, and the Hand and
Club of Orion, used a telescope of the Newtonian
form, 20-feet focal length, and 18<sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches diameter,
with a power of only 157. On applying this
telescope and power to a part of the <i>Via Lactea</i>,
he found that it completely resolved the whole
whitish appearance into stars, which his former
telescopes had not light enough to effect; and
which smaller instruments with much higher magnifying
powers would not have effected. He tells
us, that with this power, ‘the glorious multitude
of stars,’ in the vicinity of Orion, ‘of all possible
sizes, that presented themselves to view, was truly
astonishing, and that he had fields which contained
70, 90 and 110 stars, so that a belt of 15 degrees
long, and 2 degrees broad, which passed through
the field of the telescope in an hour, could not
contain less than fifty thousand stars that were
large enough to be distinctly numbered.’ In
viewing the Milky way, the Nebul&aelig;, and small
clusters of stars, such as <i>Pr&aelig;sepe</i> in Cancer, I
generally use a power of 55 times, on an achromatic
telescope 6 feet 6 inches in focal length, and
4 inches diameter. The eye-piece, which produces
this power&mdash;which I formed for the purpose&mdash;consists
of two convex lenses, the one next the
eye 3 inches focal length, and 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch diameter,
and that next the object 3&frac12; inches focus, and 1<sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
inch diameter, the deepest convex surfaces being
next each other, and their distance &frac14; inch. With this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
eye-piece a very large and brilliant field of view is
obtained; and I find it preferable to any higher
powers in viewing the nebulosities, and clusters of
stars. In certain spaces of the heavens, it sometimes
presents in one field, nearly a hundred stars.
It likewise serves to exhibit a very clear and interesting
view of the full moon.</p>

<p>In observing <i>Comets</i>, a very small power should
generally be used, even on large instruments.
These bodies possess so small a quantity of light,
and they are so frequently enveloped in a veil of
dense atmosphere, that <i>magnifying</i> power sometimes
renders them more obscure; and therefore
the <i>illuminating</i> power of a large telescope, with
a small power, is in all cases to be preferred. A
comet eye-piece should be constructed with a very
large and uniformly distinct field, and should magnify
only from 15 to 30 or 40 times, and the lenses
of such an eye-tube should be nearly two inches
in diameter. The late Rev. F. Wollaston recommended
for observing comets, ‘a telescope with an
achromatic object-glass of 16 inches focal length,
and 2 inches aperture, with a Ramsden’s eye-glass
magnifying about 25 times, mounted on a very
firm equatorial stand, the field of view taking in
2 degrees of a great circle.’</p>

<p>In viewing the <i>moon</i>, various powers may be
applied according to circumstances. The best
periods of the moon for inspecting the inequalities
on its surface, are either when it assumes a
crescent or a half-moon phase, or two or three
days after the period of half-moon. Several days
after full-moon, and particularly about the third
quarter, when this orb is waning, and when the
shadows of its mountains and vales are thrown in
a different direction from what they are when on
the increase,&mdash;the most prominent and interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
views may be obtained. The most convenient
season for obtaining such views is during the
autumnal months, when the moon, about the
third quarter, sometimes rises as early as 8 o’clock
<small>P.M.</small>, and may be viewed at a considerably high
altitude by ten or eleven. When in the positions
now alluded to, and at a high altitude, very high
magnifying powers may sometimes be applied with
good effect, especially if the atmosphere be clear
and serene. I have sometimes applied a power,
in such cases, of 350 times, on a 46-inch achromatic,
with considerable distinctness; but it is
only two or three times in a year, and when the
atmosphere is remarkably favourable, that such a
power can be used. The autumnal evenings are
generally best fitted for such observations. The
<i>full moon</i> is an object which is never seen to
advantage with high powers, as no shadows or
inequalities on its surface can then be perceived.
It forms, however, a very beautiful object, when
magnifying powers not higher than 40, 50, or
60 times are used. A power of 45 times, if properly
constructed, will show the <i>whole of the moon</i>
with a margin around it, when the darker and
brighter parts of its surface will present a variegated
aspect, and appear somewhat like a map to
the eye of the observer.</p>

<p>4. <i>Mode of exhibiting the Solar spots.</i></p>

<p>The solar spots may be contemplated with
advantage by magnifying powers varying from 60
to 180 times; about 90 times is a good medium
power, though they may sometimes be distinguished
with very low powers, such as those
usually adapted to a one-foot telescope, or even
by means of a common opera-glass. The common
astronomical eye-pieces given along with achromatic
telescopes, and the sun-glasses connected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
with them, are generally ill-adapted for taking a
pleasant and comprehensive view of the solar spots.
In the higher magnifying powers, the first eye-glass
is generally at too great a distance from the
eye, and the sun-glass which is screwed over it,
removes it to a still greater distance from the
point to which the eye is applied, so that not
above one third of the field of view can be taken
in. This circumstance renders it difficult to point
the instrument to any particular small spot on the
solar disk which we wish minutely to inspect; and
besides, it prevents us from taking a comprehensive
view of the <i>relative positions</i> of all the spots
that may at any time be traversing the disk. To
obviate this inconvenience, the sun-glass would
require to be placed so near to the glass next the
eye as almost to touch it. But this is sometimes
difficult to be attained, and, in high powers,
even the thickness of the sun-glass itself is sufficient
to prevent the eye from taking in the whole
field of view. For preventing the inconveniences
to which I now allude, I generally make use of a
<i>terrestrial</i> eye-piece of a considerable power, with
a large field, the sun-glass is fixed at the end of a
short tube which slides on the eye-piece, and permits
the coloured glass to approach within a line
or two of the lens next the eye, so that the whole
field of the telescope is completely secured. The
eye-piece alluded to carries a magnifying power
of 95 times for a 46-inch telescope, and takes in
about three fourths of the surface of the sun, so
that the relative positions of all the spots may
generally be perceived at one view. Such a power
is, in most cases, quite sufficient for ordinary observations;
and I have seldom found any good
effect to arise from attempting very high powers,
when minutely examining the solar spots.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

<p>But, the most pleasant mode of viewing the
solar spots&mdash;especially when we wish to exhibit
them to others&mdash;is to throw the image of the sun
upon a white screen, placed in a room which is
considerably darkened. It is difficult, however,
when the sun is at a high altitude, to put this
method into practice, on account of the great
obliquity with which his rays then fall, which
prevents a screen from being placed at any considerable
distance from the eye-end of the telescope.
The following plan, therefore, is that
which I uniformly adopt as being both the easiest
and the most satisfactory. A telescope is placed
in a convenient position, so as to be directed to
the sun. This telescope is furnished with a <i>diagonal
eye-piece</i>, such as that represented, fig. 77,
(p. 344.) The window-shutters of the apartment
are all closed, excepting a space sufficient
to admit the solar rays; and, when the telescope
is properly adjusted, a beautiful image of the
sun, with all the spots which then happen to diversify
his surface, is thrown upon the <i>ceiling</i> of the
room. This image may be from 12 to 20, or 30
inches or more in diameter, according to the distance
of the ceiling from the diagonal eye-piece.
The greater this distance is, the larger the image.
If the sun is at a very high altitude, the image
will be elliptical; if he be at no great distance
from the horizon, the image will appear circular
or nearly so; but in either case the spots will be
distinctly depicted, provided the focus of the telescope
be accurately adjusted. In this exhibition,
the apparent motion of the sun, produced by the
rotation of the earth, and the passage of thin
fleeces of clouds across the solar disk, exhibit a
very pleasing appearance.</p>

<p>By this mode of viewing the solar spots we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
easily ascertain their diameter and magnitude, at
least to a near approximation. We have only to
take a scale of inches, and measure the diameter
of any well-defined and remarkable spot, and then
the diameter of the solar image; and, comparing
the one with the other, we can ascertain the
number of miles either lineal or square, comprehended
in the dimensions of the spot. For
example, suppose a spot to measure one half-inch
in diameter, and the whole image of the sun 25
inches, the proportion between the diameter of
the spot and that of the sun will be as 1 to 50, in
other words, the <i>one fiftieth</i> part of the sun’s
diameter. Now, this diameter being 880,000
miles, this number, divided by 50, produces a
quotient of 17,600 = the number of miles which
its diameter measures. Such a spot will therefore
contain an area of 243,285,504, or more than two
hundred and forty-three millions of square miles,
which is 46 millions of miles more than the
whole superficies of the terraquous globe. Again,
suppose the diameter of a spot measures <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch,
and the solar image 23 inches, the proportion of
the diameter of the spot to that of the sun is as 3 to
230 = the number of tenths in 23 inches. The
number of miles in the spot’s diameter will therefore
be found by the following proportion: 230 :
880,000 :: 3 : 11,478; that is, the diameter of
such a spot measures eleven thousand four hundred
and seventy-eight miles. Spots of such sizes are
not unfrequently seen to transit the solar disk.</p>

<p>By this mode of viewing the image of the sun,
his spots may be exhibited to twenty or thirty
individuals at once without the least straining or
injury to the eyes; and as no separate screen is
requisite, and as the ceilings of rooms are generally
white, the experiment may be performed in half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
a minute without any previous preparation, except
screwing on and adjusting the eye-piece. The
manner of exhibiting the solar spots, in this way,
is represented in fig. 82.</p>

<p>5. <i>On the space-penetrating power of telescopes.</i>&mdash;The
power of telescopes to penetrate into the
profundity of space is the result of the quantity
of light they collect and send to the eye in a state
fit for vision. This property of telescopes is
sometimes designated by the expression <i>Illuminating
Power</i>.</p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel appears to have been the first
who made a distinction between the <i>magnifying</i>
power, and the <i>space-penetrating</i> power of a
telescope; and there are many examples which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
prove that such a distinction ought to be made,
especially in the case of large instruments. For
example, the small star, or speck of light, which
accompanies the pole-star, may be seen through a
telescope of large aperture, with a smaller magnifying
power than with a telescope of a small aperture
furnished with a much higher power. If the
magnifying power is sufficient to show the small
star completely separated from the rays which
surround the large one, this is sufficient in one
point of view; but in order that this effect may
be produced, so as to render the small star perfectly
distinguishable, a certain quantity of light
must be admitted into the pupil of the eye&mdash;which
quantity depends upon the area of the
object-glass or speculum of the instrument, or, in
other words, on the illuminating power. If we
compare a telescope of 2&frac34; inches aperture with
one of 5 inches aperture, when the magnifying
power of each does not exceed 50 times for terrestrial
objects, the effect of illuminating power is
not so evident; but if we use a power of 100 for
day objects, and 180 for the heavenly bodies, the
effects of illuminating power is so clearly perceptible,
that objects not only appear brighter, and
more clearly visible, in the larger telescope, but
with the same magnifying power, they also <i>appear</i>
larger, particularly when the satellites of Jupiter
and small stars are the objects we are viewing.</p>

<p>Sir W. Herschel remarks, that ‘objects are
viewed in their greatest perfection, when, in penetrating
space, the magnifying power is so low as
only to be sufficient to show the object well&mdash;and
when, in magnifying objects, by way of examining
them minutely, the space-penetrating power is no
higher than what will suffice for the purpose; for in
the use of either power, the injudicious overcharge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
of the other will prove hurtful to vision.’ When
illuminating power is in too high a degree, the
eye is offended by the extreme brightness of the
object. When it is in too low a degree, the eye
is distressed by its endeavours to see what is
beyond its reach; and therefore it is desirable,
when we wish to give the eye all the assistance
possible, to have the illuminating and the magnifying
powers in due proportion. What this proportion
is, depends, in a certain degree, upon the
brightness of the object. In proportion to its
brightness or luminosity, the magnifying power
may, to a certain extent, be increased. Sir W.
Herschel remarks, in reference to α Lyr&aelig;, ‘This
star, I surmise, has light enough to bear being
magnified, at least a hundred thousand times, with
no more than six inches of aperture.’ However
beautifully perfect any telescopes may appear, and
however sharp their <i>defining</i> power, their performance
is limited by their illuminating powers&mdash;which
are as the squares of the diameters of the
apertures of the respective instruments. Thus, a
telescope whose object-glass is 4 inches diameter
will have four times the quantity of light, or illuminating
power, possessed by a telescope whose
aperture is only 2 inches, or in the proportion of
16 to 4,&mdash;the square of 4 being 16, and the square
of 2 being 4.</p>

<p>The nature of the <i>space-penetrating power</i>, to
which we are adverting, and the distinction between
it, and magnifying power, may be illustrated from a
few examples taken from Sir W. Herschel’s observations.</p>

<p>The first observation which I shall notice refers
to the <i>nebula</i> between η and ζ Ophiuchi, discovered
by Messier in 1764. The observation was made
with a 10 feet reflector, having a magnifying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
power of 250, and a space-penetrating power of
28.67. His note is dated May 3, 1783. ‘I see
several stars in it, and make no doubt a higher
power and more light will resolve it all into stars.
This seems to me a good nebula for the purpose
of establishing the connection between nebul&aelig; and
clusters of stars in general.’&mdash;‘June 18, 1784.
The same nebula viewed with a Newtonian 20
feet reflector; penetrating power 61, and a magnifying
power of 157; a very large and a very
bright cluster of excessively compressed stars.
The stars are but just visible, and are of unequal
magnitudes. The large stars are red, the cluster
is a miniature of that near Flamstead’s forty-second
Com&aelig; Berenices; Right ascension 17<sup>h</sup> 6<sup>m</sup> 32<sup>s</sup>
Polar distance 108&deg; 18&acute;&acute;’ In this case, a penetrating
power of about 28, with a magnifying
power of 250, barely shewed a few stars; when in
the second instrument the illuminating power of
60 with the magnifying power of only 157 showed
them completely.</p>

<p>Subsequently to the date of the latter observation,
the 20 feet Newtonian telescope was converted
into an Herschelian instrument, by taking
away the small speculum, and giving the large one
the proper inclination for obtaining the front view;
by which alteration the illuminating power was
increased from 61 to 75, and the advantage derived
from the alteration was evident in the discovery of
the satellites of Uranus by the altered telescope,
which before was incompetent in the point of
penetration, or illuminating power. ‘March 14,
1798, I viewed the Georgian planet (or Uranus)
with a new 25 feet reflector. Its penetrating
power is 95.85, and having just before also viewed
it with my 20 feet instrument, I found that with
an equal magnifying power of 300, the 25 feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
telescope had considerably the advantage of the
former.’ The aperture of the 20 feet instrument
was 18.8 inches, and that of the 25 feet telescope,
24 inches, so that the superior effect of the latter
instrument must have been owing to its greater
illuminating power. The following observations
show the superior power of the 40 feet telescope
as compared with the 20 feet.&mdash;‘Feb. 24, 1786, I
viewed the nebula near Flamstead’s fifth Serpentis,
with my 20 feet reflector, magnifying power 157.
The most beautiful extremely compressed cluster
of small stars; the greatest part of them gathered
together into one brilliant nucleus, evidently
consisting of stars, surrounded with many detached
gathering stars of the same size and colour. R.A.
15<sup>h</sup> 7<sup>m</sup> 12<sup>s</sup>. P.D. 87&deg; 8&acute;&acute;’&mdash;‘May 27, 1791, I
viewed the same object with my 40 feet telescope,
penetrating power 191.69, magnifying power 370.
A beautiful cluster of stars. I counted about 200
of them. The middle of it is so compressed, that
it is impossible to distinguish the stars.’&mdash;‘Nov.
5, 1791, I viewed Saturn with the 20 and 40 feet
telescopes. <i>Twenty feet.</i> The fifth satellite of
Saturn is very small. The first, second, third,
fourth and fifth, and the new sixth satellites are in
their calculated places. <i>Forty feet.</i> I see the
new sixth satellite much better with this instrument
than with the 20 feet. The fifth is also
much larger here than in the 20 feet, in which it
was nearly the same size as a small fixed star, but
here it is considerably larger than that star.’</p>

<p>These examples, and many others of a similar
kind, explain sufficiently the nature and extent of
that species of power that one telescope possesses
over another, in consequence of its enlarged
aperture; but the exact quantity of this power is
in some degree uncertain. To ascertain practically
the illuminating power of telescopes, we must try
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
them with equal powers on such objects as the
following,&mdash;the small stars near the pole-star, and
near Rigel and ε Bootis&mdash;the division in the ring
of Saturn&mdash;and distant objects in the twilight or
towards the evening. These objects are distinctly
seen with a 5 feet achromatic of 3<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches aperture,
and an illuminating power of 144, while they
are scarcely visible in a 3&frac12; feet with an aperture
of 2&frac34; inches, and an illuminating power of 72,
supposing the same magnifying power to be applied.
The illuminating power of a telescope is best
estimated, in regard to land objects, when it is
tried on minute objects, and such as are badly
lighted up; and the advantage of a telescope with
a large aperture will be most obvious, when it is
compared with another of inferior size in the close
of the evening, when looking at a printed bill
composed of letters of various sizes. As darkness
comes on, the use of illuminating power becomes
more evident. In a 5 feet telescope some small
letters will be legible, which are hardly discernible
in the 3&frac12; feet, and in the 2&frac12; feet are quite undefinable,
though the magnifying powers be equal.
Sir W. Herschel informs us, that in the year 1776,
when he had erected a telescope of 20 feet focal
length of the Newtonian construction, one of its
effects by trial was, that when towards evening, on
account of darkness, the natural eye could not
penetrate far into space, the telescope possessed
that power sufficiently to show, by the dial of a
distant church steeple, what o’clock it was, notwithstanding
the naked eye could no longer see
the steeple itself.</p>

<p>In order to convey an idea of the <i>numbers</i> by
which the degree of space-penetrating power is
expressed, and the general grounds on which they
rest, the following statements may be made. The
depth to which the naked eye can penetrate into the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
spaces of the heavens, is considered as extending
to the twelfth order of distances&mdash;in other words,
it can perceive a star at a distance 12 times farther
than those luminaries, such as Sirius, Arcturus or
Capella, which, from their vivid light, we presume
to be nearest to us. It has been stated above, that
Herschel calculated his 10 feet telescope to have
a space-penetrating power of 28.67, that is, it
could enable us to descry a star 28 times farther
distant than the naked eye can reach. His 20
feet Newtonian was considered as having a similar
power of 61; his 25 feet, nearly 96, and his 40
feet instrument, a power of 191.69. If each of
these numbers be multiplied by 12, the product
will indicate how much farther these telescopes
will penetrate into space than the nearest range of
the fixed stars, such as those of the first magnitude.
For instance, the penetrating power of the
40 feet reflector being 191.69, this number multiplied
by 12, gives a product of 2,300, which
shows, that were there a series of two thousand
three hundred stars extended in a line beyond
Sirius, Capella and similar stars&mdash;each star separated
from the one beyond it, by a space equal to
the distance of Sirius from the earth&mdash;they might
be all seen through the 40 feet telescope. In
short, the penetrating power of telescopes is a
circumstance which requires to be particularly
attended to in our observations of celestial phenomena,
and in many cases, is of more importance
than <i>magnifying</i> power. It is the effect produced
by illuminating power that renders telescopes,
furnished with comparatively small magnifying
powers, much more efficient in observing comets
and certain nebul&aelig; and clusters of stars, than when
high powers are attempted. Every telescope may
be so adjusted, as to produce different space-penetrating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
powers. If we wish to diminish such a
power, we have only to contract the object-glass
or speculum, by placing circular rims, or apertures
of different degrees of breadth, across the mouth
of the great tube of the instrument. But we cannot
increase this illuminating power beyond a
certain extent, which is limited by the diameter
of the object-glass. When we wish illuminating
power beyond this limit, we must be furnished
with an object-glass or speculum of a larger size;
and hence, the rapid advance in price of instruments
which have large apertures, and consequently
high illuminating powers. Mr. Tulley’s
3&frac12; feet achromatics of 2&frac34; inches aperture, sell at
&pound;26 5s. When the aperture is 3&frac14; inches, the
price is &pound;42. When 3&frac34; inches, &pound;68 5s. The
following table contains a statement of the ‘comparative
lengths, apertures, illuminating powers,
and prices, of Achromatic Refractors, and Gregorian
Reflectors,’ according to Dr. Kitchener.</p>

<p>6. <i>On choosing Telescopes, and ascertaining
their properties.</i></p>

<p>It is an object of considerable importance, to
every astronomical observer, that he should be
enabled to form a judgment of the qualities of his
telescope, and of any instruments of this description
which he may intend to purchase. The
following directions may perhaps be useful to the
reader in directing him in the choice of an achromatic
refracting telescope.</p>

<p>Supposing that an achromatic telescope of 3&frac12;
feet focal length, and 3&frac14; inches aperture were
offered for sale, and that it were required to ascertain
whether the object-glass, on which its excellence
chiefly depends&mdash;is a good one and duly
adjusted;&mdash;some opinion may be formed by laying
the tube of the telescope in a horizontal position,
on a firm support, about the height of the eye,&mdash;and
by placing a printed card or a watch glass
vertically, but in an inverted position, against some
wall or pillar, at 40 or 50 yards distant, so as to
be exposed to a clear sky. When the telescope
is directed to this object, and accurately adjusted
to the eye&mdash;should the letters on the card, or the
strokes and dots on the watch-glass appear clearly
and sharply defined, without any mistiness or
coloration, and if very small points appear well
defined&mdash;great hopes may be entertained that the
glass will turn out a good one. But a telescope
may appear a good one, when viewing common
terrestrial objects, to eyes unaccustomed to discriminate
deviations from perfect vision, while it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
may turn out to be an indifferent one, when
directed to certain celestial objects. Instead therefore
of a printed card, fix a black board, or one
half of a sheet of black paper, in a vertical position
at the same distance, and a circular disk of
white writing paper, about &frac14; of an inch in diameter,
on the centre of the black ground. Then
having directed the telescope to this object, and
adjusted for the place of distinct vision, mark with
a black-lead pencil the sliding eye-tube, at the
end of the main tube, so that this position can
always be known; and if this sliding tube be
gradually drawn out, or pushed in, while the eye
beholds the disk, it will gradually enlarge and lose
its colour, till its edges cease to be well-defined.
Now, if the enlarged misty circle is observed to
be concentric with the disk itself, the object-glass
is properly centered, as it has reference to the
tube; but if the misty circle goes to one side of
the disk, the cell of the object-glass is not at right
angles to the tube, and must have its screws removed
and its holes elongated, by a rattailed file,
small enough to enter the holes. When this has
been done, the cell may be replaced, and the disk
examined a second time, and a slight stroke on
one edge of the cell, by a wooden mallet, will
show by the alteration made in the position of the
misty portion of the disk, how the adjustment is
to be effected, which is known to be right when a
motion in the sliding tube will make the diluted
disk enlarge in a circle concentric with the disk
itself. When the disk will enlarge so as to make
a ring of diluted white light round its circumference,
as the sliding tube holding the eye-piece is
pushed in or drawn out, the cell may be finally
fixed by the screws passing through its elongated
holes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

<p>When the object-glass is thus adjusted, it may
then be ascertained whether the curves of the
respective lenses composing the object-glass are
well-formed and suitable for each other. If a
small motion of the sliding tube of about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th of an
inch in a 3&frac12; feet telescope, from the point of distinct
vision, will dilute the light of the disk and
render the appearance confused, the figure of the
object-glass is good; particularly if the same effect
will take place at equal distances from the point of
distinct vision, when the tube is alternately drawn
out and pushed in. A telescope that will admit
of much motion in the sliding tube without sensibly
affecting the distinctness of vision, will not
define an object well at any point of adjustment,
and must be considered as having an imperfect
object-glass, inasmuch as the spherical aberration
of the transmitted rays is not duly corrected. The
due adjustment of the convex lens, or lenses, to
the concave one, will be judged of by the absence
of coloration round the enlarged disk, and is a
property distinct from the spherical aberration;
the achromatism depending on the relative focal
distances of the convex and concave lenses, is
regulated by the relative dispersive powers of the
pieces of glass made use of; but the distinctness
of vision depends on a good figure of the computed
curves that limit the focal distances. When
an object-glass is free from imperfection in both
these respects, it may be called a good glass for
terrestrial purposes.</p>

<p>It still, however, remains to be determined how
far such an object-glass may be good for viewing
a star or a planet, and can only be known by
actual observations on the heavenly bodies. When
a good telescope is directed to the moon or to
Jupiter, the achromatism may be judged of, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
alternately pushing in, and drawing out the eye-piece,
from the place of distinct vision. In the
former case, a ring of purple will be formed round
the edge; and in the latter, a ring of light green,
which is the central colour of the prismatic spectrum;
for these appearances show, that the extreme
colours red and violet are corrected.
Again, if one part of a lens employed have a
different refractive power from another part of it,
that is, if the flint-glass particularly is not homogeneous,
a star of the first and even of the second
magnitude will point out the natural defect by
the exhibition of an irradiation, or what is called
<i>a wing</i>, at one side, which no perfection of figure
or of adjustment will banish, and the greater the
aperture the more liable is the evil to happen.
Hence caps with different apertures are usually
supplied with large telescopes, that the extreme
parts of the glass may be cut off, in observations
requiring a round and well-defined image of the
body observed.</p>

<p>Another method of determining the figure and
quality of an object-glass is by first covering its
centre by a circular piece of paper, as much as
one half of its diameter, and adjusting it for distinct
vision of a given object, such as the disk
above mentioned, when the central rays are intercepted&mdash;and
then trying if the focal length remains
unaltered when the paper is taken away, and an
aperture of the same size applied, so that the
extreme rays may in their turn be cut off. If the
vision remains equally distinct in both cases, without
any new adjustment for focal distance, the
figure is good, and the spherical aberration cured,
and it may be seen by viewing a star of the first
magnitude successively in both cases, whether the
irradiation is produced more by the extreme or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
by the central parts of the glass. Or, in case the
one half be faulty and the other good, a semicircular
aperture, by being turned gradually round in
trial, will detect what semicircle contains the
defective portion of the glass; and if such portion
should be covered, the only inconvenience that
would ensue, would be the loss of so much light
as is thus excluded. When an object-glass produces
radiations in a large star, it is unfit for the
nicer observations of astronomy, such as viewing
double stars of the first class. The smaller a
large star appears in any telescope, the better is
the figure of the object-glass, but if the image of
the star be free from wings, the size of its disk is
not an objection in practical observations.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>Some opticians are in the habit of inserting a
diaphragm into the body of the large tube, to cut
off the extreme rays coming from the object-glass
when the figure is not good, instead of lessening
the aperture by a cap. When this is the case, a
deficiency of light will be the consequence beyond
what the apparent aperture warrants. It is therefore
proper to examine that the diaphragm be not
placed too near the object-glass, so as to intercept
any of the useful rays. Sometimes a portion of the
object-glass is cut off by the stop in the eye-tube.
To ascertain this, adjust the telescope to distinct
vision, then take out the eye-glasses, and put
your finger on some other object on the edge of
the outside of the object-glass, and look down
the tube; if you can see the tip of your finger, or
any object in its place, just peeping over the edge
of the object-glass, no part is cut off. I once had
a 3&frac12; feet telescope whose object-glass measured 3
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
inches diameter, which was neither so bright, nor
did it perform in other respects nearly so well as
another of the same length whose object-glass was
only 2&frac34; inches diameter; but I found that a
diaphragm was placed about a foot within the
end of the large tube, which reduced the aperture
of the object-glass to less than 2&frac12; inches; and
when it was removed the telescope was less distinct
than before. The powers given along with
this instrument were much lower than usual&mdash;none
of them exceeding 100 times. This is a
trick not uncommon with some opticians.</p>

<p>Dr. Pearson mentions that an old Dollond’s
telescope of 63 inches focal length, and 3&frac34; inches
aperture, supposed to be an excellent one, was
brought to Mr. Tulley, when he was present, and
the result of the examination was that its achromatism
was not perfect. The imperfection was
thus determined by experiment. A small glass
globe was placed at 40 yards distance from the
object-end of the telescope when the sun was
shining, and the speck of light seen reflected from
this globe formed a good substitute for a large
star, as an object to be viewed. When the focal
length of the object-glass was adjusted to this
luminous object, no judgment could be formed of
its prismatic aberrations, till the eye-piece had
been pushed in beyond the place of correct vision;
but when the telescope was shortened a little, the
luminous disk occasioned by such shortening was
strongly tinged with <i>red</i> rays at its circumference.
On the contrary, when the eye-piece was drawn out,
so as to lengthen the telescope too much, the disk
thus produced was tinged with a small circle of
<i>red</i> at its <i>centre</i>, thereby denoting that the convex
lens had too short a focal length; and Mr.
Tulley observed, that if one or both of the curves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
of the convex lens were flattened till the total
focal length should be about 4 inches increased,
it would render the telescope quite achromatic,
provided in doing this the aberration should not
be increased.</p>

<p>The following general remarks may be added.
1. To make anything like an accurate comparison
of telescopes, they must be tried not only at the
same place, but as nearly as possible at the same
time, and, if the instruments are of the same
length and construction, if possible, with the
same eye-piece. 2. A difference of 8 or 10 times
in the magnifying power, will sometimes, on
certain objects, give quite a different character to
a telescope. It has been found by various experiments
that object-glasses of two or three inches
longer focus will produce different vision with the
same eye-piece. 3. Care must be taken to ascertain
that the eye-glasses are perfectly clean and
free from defects. The defects of glass are either
from veins&mdash;specks&mdash;scratches&mdash;colour, or an incorrect
figure. To discover veins in an eye or an
object-glass, place a candle at the distance of 4
or 5 yards; then look through the glass, and
move it from your eye till it appear full of light&mdash;you
will then see every vein, or other imperfection
in it which may distort the objects and render
vision imperfect. Specks or scratches, especially
in object-glasses, are not so injurious as veins, for
they do not distort the object, but only intercept
a portion of the light. 4. We cannot judge
accurately of the excellence of any telescope by
observing objects with which we are not familiarly
acquainted. Opticians generally try an instrument
at their own marks, such as the dial-plate of
a watch, a finely engraved card, a weather-cock,
or the moon and the planet Jupiter, when near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
the meridian. Of several telescopes of the same
length, aperture and magnifying power, that one
is generally considered the best with which we
can read a given print at the greatest distance,
especially if the print consists of <i>figures</i>, such as
a table of logarithms, where the eye is not apt to
be deceived by the imagination, in <i>guessing</i> at the
sense of a passage, when two or three words are
distinguished.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance which I have frequently
noticed, in reference to achromatic telescopes,
particularly those of a small size, and which I
have never seen noticed by any optical writer. It
is this,&mdash;if the telescope, when we are viewing
objects, be gradually turned round its axis, there
is a certain position in which the objects will
appear distinct and accurately defined; and if it
be turned round exactly a semicircle from this
point, the same degree of distinctness is perceived;
but in all other positions, there is an evident want
of clearness and defining power. This I find to
be the case in more than ten 1 foot and 2 feet
telescopes now in my possession; and therefore I
have put marks upon the object-end of each of
them, to indicate the positions in which they
should be used for distinct observation.&mdash;This is a
circumstance which requires, in many cases, to be
attended to in the choice and the use of telescopical
instruments, and in fixing and adjusting
them on their pedestals. In some telescopes this
defect is very striking, but it is in some measure
perceptible in the great majority of instruments
which I have had occasion to inspect. Even in
large and expensive achromatic telescopes this
defect is sometimes observable. I have an achromatic
whose object-glass is 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches diameter,
which was much improved in its defining power,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
by being unscrewed from its original position, or
turned round its axis&mdash;about one-eighth part of
its circumference. This defect is best detected by
looking at a large printed bill, or a sign-post at a
distance, when, on turning round the telescope
or object-glass, the letters will appear much better
defined in one position than in another. The
position in which the object appears least distinct
is when the upper part of the telescope is a
quadrant of a circle different from the two positions
above-stated, or at an equal distance from
each of them.</p>

<p>7. <i>On the mode of determining the magnifying
power of Telescopes.</i></p>

<p>In regard to refracting telescopes, we have
already shown that, when a single eye-glass is
used, the magnifying power may be found by
dividing the focal distance of the object-glass by
that of the eye-glass. But when a Huygenian
eye-piece, or a four-glass terrestrial eye-piece such
as is now common in achromatic telescopes, is
used, the magnifying power cannot be ascertained
in this manner; and in some of the delicate
observations of practical astronomy, it is of the
utmost importance to know the exact magnifying
power of the instrument with which the observations
are made, particularly when micrometrical
measurements are employed to obtain the desired
results.&mdash;The following is a general method of
finding the magnifying powers of telescopes when
the instrument called a <i>dynameter</i> is not employed;
and it answers for refracting and reflecting telescopes
of every description.</p>

<p>Having put up a small circle of paper, an inch
or two in diameter, at the distance of about 100
yards, draw upon a card 2 black parallel lines,
whose distance from each other is equal to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
diameter of the paper circle. Then view through
the telescope the paper circle with one eye, and
the parallel lines with the other; and let the
parallel lines be moved nearer to or further from,
the eye, till they seem exactly to cover the small
circle viewed through the telescope. The quotient
obtained by dividing the distance of the paper
circle by the distance of the parallel lines from the
eye, will be the magnifying power of the telescope.
It requires a little practice before this experiment
can be performed with accuracy. The one eye
must be accustomed to look at an object near at
hand, while the other is looking at a more distant
object through the telescope. Both eyes must be
open at the same time, and the image of the
object seen through the telescope must be brought
into apparent contact with the real object near at
hand. But a little practice will soon enable any
observer to perform the experiment with ease and
correctness, if the telescope be mounted on a firm
stand, and its elevation or depression produced by
rack-work.</p>

<p>The following is another method, founded on
the same principle:&mdash;Measure the space occupied
by a number of the courses, or rows of bricks in
a modern building&mdash;which, upon an average, is
found to have 8 courses in 2 feet, so that each
course or row, is 3 inches. Then cut a piece of
paper 3 inches in height, and of the length of a
brick&mdash;which is about 9 inches&mdash;so that it may
represent a brick, and fixing the paper against
the brick wall, place the telescope to be examined
at the distance of about 80 or 100 yards from it.
Now, looking through the telescope at the paper
with one eye, and at the same time, with the other
eye, looking past the telescope, observe what extent
of wall the magnified image of the paper appears to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
cover, then count the courses of bricks in that extent,
and it will give the magnifying power of the telescope.
It is to be observed, however, that the magnifying
power determined in this way, will be a fraction
greater than for very distant objects, as the focal
distance of the telescope is necessarily lengthened
in order to obtain distinct vision of near objects.</p>

<p>In comparing the magnifying powers of two
telescopes, or of the same telescope, when different
magnifying powers are employed, I generally use
the following simple method. The telescopes are
placed at 8 or 10 feet distant from a window, with
their eye-ends parallel to each other, or at the
same distance from the window. Looking at a
distant object, I fix upon a portion of it whose
magnified image will appear to fill exactly two or
three panes of the window. Then putting on a
different power, or looking through another telescope,
I observe the same object, and mark exactly
the extent of its image on the window-panes, and
compare the extent of the one image with the
other. Suppose for example, that the one telescope
has been previously found to magnify 90
times, and that the image of the object fixed upon
exactly fills three panes of the window, and that
with the other power or the other telescope, the
image fills exactly two panes, then the magnifying
power is equal to two thirds of the former, or 60
times; and were it to fill only one pane, the
power would be about 30 times. A more correct
method is to place at one side of the window, a
narrow board, two or three feet long, divided into
15 or 20 equal parts, and observe how many of
these parts appear to be covered by the respective
images, of the different telescopes. Suppose, in
the one case, 10 divisions to be covered by the
image, in a telescope magnifying 90 times, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
that the image of the same object in another
telescope, measures 6 divisions, then its power is
found by the following proportion, 10 : 90 : 6 : 54 :
that is, this telescope magnifies 54 times.</p>

<p>Another mode which I have used for determining,
to a near approximation, the powers of telescopes,
is as follows:&mdash;Endeavour to find the focus
of a single lens which is exactly equivalent to the
magnifying power of the eye-piece, whether the
Huygenian or the common terrestrial eye-piece.
This may be done by taking a small lens, and
using it as an object-glass to the eye-piece. Looking
through the eye-piece to a window and holding
the lens at a proper distance, observe whether the
image of one of the panes exactly coincides with
the pane, as seen by the naked eye; if it does,
then the magnifying power of the eye-piece is
equal to that of the lens. If the lens be &frac12; inch
focal length, the eye-piece will produce the same
magnifying power, as a single lens when used as
an eye-glass to the telescope, and the magnifying
power will then be found by dividing the focal
distance of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass.
But if the image of the pane of glass does
not exactly coincide with the pane as seen by the
other eye, then proportional parts may be taken
by observing the divisions of such a board as described
above, or we may try lenses of different
focal distances. Suppose, for example, that a
lens 2 inches focal length had been used, and that
the image of a pane covered exactly the space of
two panes, the power of the eye-piece is then
equal to that of a single lens 1 inch focal distance.</p>

<p>The following is another mode depending on the
same general principle. If a slip of writing-paper
one inch long, or a disk of the same material
of one inch diameter, be placed on a black ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
at from 30 to 50 yards distance from the object-end
of the telescope, and a staff painted white,
and divided into inches and parts by strong black
lines, be placed vertically near the said paper or
disk; the eye that is directed through the telescope
when adjusted for vision, will see the magnified
disk, and the other eye, looking along the outside
of the telescope, will observe the number of inches
and parts that the disk projected on it will just
cover, and as many inches as are thus covered will
indicate the magnifying power of the telescope&mdash;at
the distance for which it is adjusted for distinct
vision. The solar power, or powers for very distant
objects, may be obtained by the following
proportion:&mdash;As the terrestrial focal length, at the
given distance: is to the solar focal length :: so
is the terrestrial power, to the solar power. For
example, a disk of white paper one inch in diameter,
was placed on a black board, and suspended
on a wall contiguous to a vertical black staff that
was graduated into inches by strong white lines, at
a distance of 33 yards 2&frac12; feet, and when the adjustment
for vision was made with a 42 inch telescope,
the left eye of the observer viewed the
disk projected on the staff, while the right eye
observed that the enlarged image of the disk
covered just 58&frac12; inches on the staff, which number
was the measure of the magnifying power, at the
distance answering to 33 yards 2&frac12; feet&mdash;which in
this case exceeded the solar focus by an inch and a
half. Then according to the above analogy, we
have, as 43.5 : 42 :: 58.5 : 56.5 nearly. Hence
the magnifying power due to the solar focal length
of the telescope in question is 56.5, and the distance
33 yards 2&frac12; feet, is that which corresponds
to an elongation of the solar focal distance an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
inch and a half.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> If we multiply the terrestrial
and the solar focal distances together, and divide
the product by their difference, we shall again
obtain the distance of the terrestrial object from
the telescope. Thus, (43.5 + 42)/1.5 = 1218 inches =
101.5 feet, or 33 yards 2&frac12; feet.</p>

<p>The magnifying power of a telescope is also
determined, by measuring the image which the
object-glass or the large speculum of a telescope
forms at its solar focus. This is accomplished by
means of an instrument called a <i>Dynameter</i>.
This apparatus consists of a strip of mother-of-pearl,
marked with equal divisions, from the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th
to the <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>th of an inch apart, according to the
accuracy required. This measure is attached to a
magnifying lens in its focus, in order to make the
small divisions more apparent. When the power
of a telescope is required, the person must measure
the clear aperture of the object-glass, then holding
the pearl <i>dynameter</i> next the eye-glass, let him
observe how many divisions the small circle of
light occupies, when the instrument is directed to
a bright object. Then by dividing the diameter
of the object-glass by the diameter of this circle
of light, the power will be obtained.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The most
accurate instrument of this kind is the <i>Double
Image Dynameter</i> invented by Ramsden, and
another on the same principle now made by
Dollond, a particular description of which may be
found in Dr. Pearson’s ‘Introduction to Practical
Astronomy.’ The advantage attending these dynameters
is that they do not require any knowledge
of the thickness and focal lengths of any of the
lenses employed in a telescope, nor yet of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
number or relative positions; neither does it make
any difference whether the construction be refracting
or reflecting, direct or inverting. One operation
includes the result arising from the most complicated
construction.</p>

<p>I shall only mention farther the following
method of discovering the magnifying power,
which is founded on the same general principle as
alluded to above. Let the telescope be placed in
such a position opposite the sun, that the rays of
light may fall perpendicularly on the object-glass;
and the pencil of rays may be received on a piece
of paper, and its diameter measured. Then, as
the diameter of the pencil of rays is to that of the
object-glass, so is the magnifying power of the
telescope.</p>

<p>8.&mdash;<i>On cleaning the lenses of telescopes.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>It is necessary, in order to distinct vision, that
the glasses, particularly the eye-glasses of telescopes
be kept perfectly clean, free of damp, dust,
or whatever may impede the transmission of the
rays of light. But great caution ought to be
exercised in the wiping of them, as they are apt
to be scratched, or otherwise injured by a rough
and incautious mode of cleaning them. They
should never be attempted to be wiped unless
they really require it; and, in this case, they
should be wiped carefully and gently with a piece
of new and soft lamb’s-skin leather. If this be
not at hand, a piece of fine silk paper, or fine
clean linen may be used as a substitute. The
lens which requires to be most particularly attended
to is the second glass from the eye, or the
field-glass; for if any dust or other impediment be
found upon this glass, it is always distinctly seen,
being magnified by the glass next the eye. The
next glass which requires attention is the fourth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
from the eye, or that which is next the object.
Unless the glass next the eye be very dusty, a few
small spots or grains of dust are seldom perceptible.
The object-glass of an achromatic should
seldom be touched, unless damp adheres to it.
Care should be taken never to use pocket handkerchiefs
or dirty rags for wiping lenses. From
the frequent use of such articles, the glasses of
seaman’s telescopes get dimmed and scratched in
in the course of a few years. If the glasses be
exceedingly dirty, and if greasy substances are
attached to them, they may be soaked in spirits
and water, and afterwards carefully wiped. In
replacing the glasses in their socket, care should
be taken not to touch the surfaces with the fingers,
as they would be dimmed with the perspiration:
they should be taken hold of by the edges only,
and carefully screwed into the same cells from
which they were taken.</p>

<h4 id="ON_MEGALASCOPES">ON MEGALASCOPES, OR TELESCOPES FOR VIEWING VERY NEAR OBJECTS.</h4>

<p>It appears to have been almost overlooked by
opticians and others, that telescopes may be constructed
so as to exhibit a beautiful and minute
view of very near objects, and to produce even a
microscopic effect, without the least alteration in
the <i>arrangement</i> of the lenses of which they are
composed. This object is effected simply by making
the eye-tube of a telescope of such a length
as to be capable of being drawn out 12 or 13
inches beyond the point of distinct vision for distant
objects. The telescope is then rendered
capable of exhibiting with distinctness all kinds of
objects, from the most distant to those which are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
placed within 3 or 4 feet of the instrument&mdash;or
not nearer than double the focal distance of the
object-glass. Our telescopes, however, are seldom
or never fitted with tubes that slide farther than
an inch or two beyond the point of distinct vision
for distant objects, although a tube of a longer
size than usual, or an additional tube would cost
but a very trifling expence.</p>

<p>The following, among many others, are some of
the objects on which I have tried many amusing
experiments with telescopes fitted up with the
long tubes to which I allude. The telescope to
which I shall more particularly advert is an achromatic,
mounted on a pedestal, having an object-glass
about 19 inches focal length, and 1⅝ inch
diameter, with magnifying powers for distant
objects of 13 and 20 times. When this instrument
is directed to a miniature portrait, 3&frac12; inches
in length, placed in a good light, at the distance
of about 8 or 10 feet, it appears as large as an
oil-painting four or five feet long, and represents
the individual as large as life. The features of
the face appear to stand out in bold relief: and
perhaps there is no representation of the human
figure that more resembles the living prototype,
than in this exhibition, provided the miniature is
finely executed. In this case the tube requires to
be pulled out four or five inches from the point of
distinct vision for distant objects, and consequently
the magnifying power is proportionally increased.
Another class of objects to which such a telescope
may be applied is <i>Perspective prints</i>, either of
public buildings, streets or landscapes. When
viewed in this way they present a panoramic appearance,
and seem nearly as natural as life&mdash;just
in the same manner as they appear in the Optical
Diagonal Machine, or when reflected in a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
concave mirror&mdash;with this advantage, that, while
in these instruments the left hand side of the
print appears where the right should be,&mdash;the
objects seen through the telescope appear exactly
in their natural position. In this case, however,
the telescope should have a small magnifying
power, not exceeding 5 or 6 times, so as to take
in the whole of the landscape. If an astronomical
eye-piece be used, the print will require to be inverted.</p>

<p>Other kinds of objects which may be viewed
with this instrument, are trees, flowers, and other
objects in gardens immediately adjacent to the
apartment in which we make our observations. In
this way we may obtain a distinct view of a variety
of rural objects, which we cannot easily approach,
such as the buds and blossoms on the tops of trees,
and the insects with which they may be infested.
There are certain objects on which the telescope
may be made to produce a powerful microscopical
effect, such as the more delicate and beautiful
kinds of flowers, the leaves of trees, and similar
objects. In viewing such objects, the telescope
may be brought within little more than double
the focal distance of the object-glass from the
objects to be viewed, and then the magnifying
power is very considerably increased. A nosegay
composed of a variety of delicate flowers, and even
a single flower, such as the sea-pink, makes a
splendid appearance in this way. A peacock’s
feather, or even the fibres on a common quill,
appear very beautiful, when placed in a proper
light. The leaves of trees, particularly the leaf of
the plane-tree, when placed against a window-pane,
so that the light may shine through them&mdash;appear,
in all their internal ramifications, more
distinct, beautiful and interesting, than when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
viewed in any other way; and in such views a
large portion of the object is at once exhibited to
the eye. In this case, the eye-piece of such a
telescope as that alluded to requires to be drawn
out 12 or 14 inches beyond the point of distinct
vision for objects at a distance&mdash;and the distance
between these near objects and the object-end of
the telescope, is only about 3&frac12; feet.</p>

<p>A telescope having a diagonal eye-piece presents
a very pleasant view of near objects in this
manner. With an instrument of this kind, I
have frequently viewed the larger kind of small
objects alluded to above, such as the leaves of
shrubs and trees, flowers consisting of a variety
of parts, the fibres of a peacock’s feather and
similar objects. In this case the object-glass of
the instrument, which is 10&frac12; inches focal length,
was brought within 22 inches of the object, and
the eye looked down upon it, in the same manner,
as when we view objects in a compound microscope.
A common pocket achromatic telescope
may be used for the purposes now stated, provided
the tube in the eye-piece containing the two lenses
next the object, be taken out, in which case the
two glasses next the eye form an astronomical
eye-piece, and the tubes may be drawn out 5 or 6
inches beyond the focal point for distant objects,
and will produce distinct vision for objects not
farther distant than about 20 or 24 inches. But,
in this case, the objects to be viewed must be
inverted, in order that they may be seen in their
natural positions when viewed through the instrument.
Telescopes of a large size and high magnifying
powers may likewise be used with advantage
for viewing very near objects in gardens
adjacent to the room in which the instruments
are placed, provided the sliding-tube next the eye
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
has a range of two or three inches beyond the
point of vision for distant objects. In this case,
a magnifying power of 100 times on a 3&frac12; or a 5
feet achromatic produces a very pleasant effect.
In making the observations to which I have now
alluded, it is requisite in order to distinct vision,
and to obtain a pleasing view of the objects, that
the instrument should be placed on a pedestal,
and capable of a motion in every direction. The
adjustment for distinct vision may be made either
by the sliding-tube, or by removing the telescope
nearer to or farther from the object.</p>

<h4 id="REFLECTIONS_ON_LIGHT_AND_VISION">REFLECTIONS ON LIGHT AND VISION&mdash;AND ON
THE NATURE AND UTILITY OF TELESCOPES.</h4>

<p>Light is one of the most wonderful and beneficial,
and at the same time one of the most mysterious
agents in the material creation. Though
the sun from which it flows to this part of our
system is nearly a hundred millions of miles from
our globe, yet we perceive it as evidently, and
feel its influence as powerfully, as if it emanated
from no higher a region than the clouds. It
supplies life and comfort to our physical system,
and without its influence and operations on the
various objects around us, we could scarcely
subsist and participate of enjoyment for a single
hour. It is diffused around us on every hand from
its fountain the sun; and even the stars, though
at a distance hundreds of thousands of times
greater than that of the solar orb, transmit to our
distant region a portion of this element. It gives
beauty and fertility to the earth, it supports the
vegetable and animal tribes, and is connected with
the various motions which are going forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
throughout the system of the universe. It unfolds
to us the whole scenery of external nature&mdash;the
lofty mountains and the expansive plains, the
majestic rivers and the mighty ocean; the trees,
the flowers, the crystal streams, and the vast
canopy of the sky adorned with ten thousands of
shining orbs. In short there is scarcely an object
within the range of our contemplation, but what
is exhibited to our understanding through the
medium of light, or at least bears a certain relation
to this enlivening and universal agent. When we
consider the extreme minuteness of the rays of
light, their inconceivable velocity, the invariable
laws by which they act upon all bodies, the multifarious
phenomena produced by their inflections,
refractions and reflections, while their original properties
remain the same; the endless variety of
colours they produce on every part of our terrestrial
creation, and the facility with which millions
of rays pass through the smallest apertures, and
pervade substances of great density, while every
ray passes forward in the crowd without disturbing
another, and produces its own specific impression&mdash;we
cannot but regard this element as the most
wonderful, astonishing and delightful part of the
material creation. When we consider the admirable
beauties and the exquisite pleasures of which
light is the essential source, and how much its
nature is still involved in mystery, notwithstanding
the profound investigations of modern philosophers,
we may well exclaim with the Poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“How then shall I attempt to sing of <span class="smcap">Him</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, light himself, in uncreated light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invested deep, dwells awfully retired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mortal eye or angel’s purer ken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose single smile has, from the first of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled, overflowing, all yon lamps of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beam for ever through the boundless sky.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomson.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span></p>

<p>The eye is the instrument by which we perceive
the beautiful and multifarious effects of this universal
agent. Its delicate and complicated structure,
its diversified muscles, its coats and membranes,
its different humours possessed of different
refractive powers, and the various contrivances
for performing and regulating its external and
internal motions, so as to accomplish the ends
intended&mdash;clearly demonstrate this organ to be a
master-piece of Divine mechanism&mdash;the workmanship
of Him whose intelligence surpasses conception,
and whose Wisdom is unsearchable. ‘Our
sight (says Addison) is the most perfect and delightful
of all our senses. It fills the mind with
the largest variety of ideas, converses with its
objects at the greatest distance, and continues the
longest in action, without being tired or satiated
with its proper enjoyments. The sense of feeling
can indeed give us a notion of extension, shape,
and all other ideas that enter the eye, except
colours; but at the same time it is very much
strained, and confined in its operation to the
number, bulk and distance of its particular objects.
Our sight seems designed to supply all these
defects, and may be considered as a more delicate
and diffusive kind of touch that spreads itself over
an infinite multitude of bodies, comprehends the
largest figures, and brings into our reach some of
the more remote parts of the universe.’</p>

<p>Could we suppose an order of beings endued
with every human faculty but that of sight, it
would appear incredible to such beings&mdash;accustomed
only to the slow information of touch&mdash;that
by the addition of an organ consisting of a ball
and socket, of an inch diameter, they might be
enabled, in an instant of time, without changing
their place, to perceive the disposition of a whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
army, the order of a battle, the figure of a magnificent
palace, or all the variety of a landscape.
If a man were by feeling to find out the figure of
the Peak of Teneriffe, or even of St. Peter’s
church at Rome, it would be the work of a lifetime.
It would appear still more incredible to
such beings as we have supposed, if they were
informed of the discoveries which may be made
by this little organ in things far beyond the reach
of any other sense&mdash;that, by means of it we can
find our way in the pathless ocean&mdash;that we can
traverse the globe of the earth, determine its
figure and dimensions, and delineate every region
of it&mdash;yea, that we can measure the planetary orbs,
and make discoveries in the sphere of the fixed
stars. And, if they were farther informed that,
by means of this same organ, we can perceive the
tempers and dispositions, the passions and affections
of our fellow-creatures, even when they
want most to conceal them&mdash;that when the tongue
is taught most artfully to lie and dissemble, the
hypocrisy should appear in the countenance to a
discerning eye&mdash;and that by this organ we can
often perceive what is straight and what is crooked
in the mind as well as in the body&mdash;would it not
appear still more astonishing to beings such as we
have now supposed?<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding these wonderful properties of
the organ of vision, the eye, when unassisted by
art, is comparatively limited in the range of its
powers. It cannot ascertain the existence of certain
objects at the distance of three or four miles,
nor perceive what is going forward in nature or
art beyond such a limit. By its natural powers
we perceive the moon to be a globe about half a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
degree in diameter, and diversified with two or
three dusky spots, and that the sun is a luminous
body of apparently the same size&mdash;that the planets
are luminous points, and that about a thousand
stars exist in the visible canopy of the sky. But
the ten thousandth part of those luminaries, which
are within the reach of human vision, can never
be seen by the unassisted eye. Here the <small>TELESCOPE</small>
interposes, and adds a new power to the
organ of vision, by which it is enabled to extend
its views to regions of space immeasurably distant,
and to objects, the number and magnitude of
which could never otherwise have been surmised
by the human imagination. By its aid we obtain
a sensible demonstration that space is boundless&mdash;that
the universe is replenished with innumerable
suns and worlds&mdash;that the remotest regions of immensity,
immeasurably beyond the limits of unassisted
vision, display the energies of Creating
Power, and that the Empire of the Creator extends
far beyond what eye hath seen or the human
imagination can conceive.</p>

<p>The telescope is an instrument of a much more
wonderful nature than what most people are apt
to imagine. However popular such instruments
now are, and however common a circumstance it
is to contemplate objects at a great distance which
the naked eye cannot discern, yet, prior to their invention
and improvement, it would have appeared
a thing most mysterious, if not impossible, that
objects at the distance of ten miles could be made
to appear as if within a few yards of us, and that
some of the heavenly bodies could be seen as
distinctly as if we had been transported by some
superior power, hundreds of millions of miles
beyond the bounds of our terrestrial habitation.
Who could ever have imagined&mdash;reasoning <i>a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
priori</i>&mdash;that the refraction of light in glass&mdash;the
same power by which a straight rod appears
crooked in water, by which vision is variously distorted,
and by which we are liable to innumerable
deceptions&mdash;that that same power, or law of
nature, by the operation of which the objects in
a landscape appear distorted when seen through
certain panes of glass in our windows, that that
power should ever be so modified and directed as
to extend the boundaries of vision, and enable us
clearly to distinguish scenes and objects at a distance
a thousand times beyond the natural limits
of our visual organs? Yet such are the discoveries
which science has achieved, such the powers
it has brought to light, that by glasses ground into
different forms, and properly adapted to each
other, we are enabled as it were to contract the
boundaries of space, to penetrate into the most
distant regions, and to bring within the reach of
our knowledge the most sublime objects in the
universe.</p>

<p>When Pliny declared in reference to Hipparchus,
the ancient astronomer, ‘<i>Ausus rem Deo
improbam annumerare posteris stellas</i>,’&mdash;that ‘he
dared to enumerate the stars for posterity, an
undertaking forbidden by God,’ what would that
natural historian have said, had it been foretold
that in less than 1600 years afterwards, a man
would arise who should enable posterity to perceive,
and to enumerate ten times more new stars
than Hipparchus ever beheld&mdash;who should point out
higher mountains on the moon than on the earth, who
should discover dark spots, as large as our globe, in
the sun, the fountain of light&mdash;who should descry
four moons revolving in different periods of time
around the planet Jupiter, and could show to
surrounding senators the varying phases of Venus?
and that another would soon after arise who should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
point out a double ring of six hundred thousand
miles in circumference, revolving around the planet
Saturn, and ten hundreds of thousands of stars
which neither Hipparchus nor any of the ancient
astronomers could ever descry? Yet these are
only a small portion of the discoveries made by
Galileo and Herschel, by means of the telescope.
Had any one prophetically informed Archimedes,
the celebrated geometrician of Syracuse, that
vision would, in after ages, be thus wonderfully
assisted by art&mdash;and further, that one manner of
improving vision would be to place a dark <i>opake</i>
body directly between the object and the eye&mdash;and
that another method would be, not to look
at the object, but to keep the eye quite in a different,
and even in an <i>opposite</i> direction, or to
stand with the back directly opposed to it, and to
behold all the parts of it, invisible to the naked
eye, most distinctly in this way&mdash;he would, doubtless
have considered the prophet as an enthusiastic
fool or a raving madman. Yet these things have
been realized in modern times in the fullest extent.
In the Gregorian reflecting telescope an
opake body, namely the small speculum near the
end of the tube, interposes <i>directly</i> between the
eye and the object. In the Newtonian Reflector,
and in the diagonal eye-pieces formerly described,
the eye is directed in a line at right angles to the
object, or a deviation of 90 degrees from the direct
line of vision. In Herschel’s’ large telescopes, and
in the <i>Aerial Reflector</i> formerly described (in pp.
311-325) the back is turned to the object, and the
eye in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>These circumstances should teach us humility
and a becoming diffidence in our own powers;
and they should admonish us not to be too dogmatical
or peremptory in affirming what is possible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
or impossible in regard either to nature or art, or
to the operations of the Divine Being. Art has
accomplished, in modern times, achievements, in
regard to locomotion, marine and a&euml;rial navigation,
the improvement of vision, the separation and
combinations of invisible gases, and numerous
other objects, of which the men of former
ages could not have formed the least conception.
And even yet, we can set no boundaries
to the future discoveries of science and the improvements
of art; but have every reason to
indulge the hope that, in the ages to come, scenes
of Divine mechanism in the system of nature will
be unfolded, and the effects of chemical and
mechanical powers displayed, of which the human
mind, in its present state of progress, cannot form
the most imperfect idea. Such circumstances
likewise should teach us not to reject any intimations
which have been made to us in relation to
the character, attributes, and dispensations of the
Divine Being, and the moral revelations of his
will given in the Sacred Records, because we are
unable to comprehend every truth and to remove
every difficulty, which relates to the moral government
of the Great Ruler of the universe. For,
if we meet with many circumstances in secular
science, and even in the common operations of
nature, which are difficult to comprehend&mdash;if even
the construction of such telescopes as we now
use, would have appeared an incomprehensible
mystery to ancient philosophers&mdash;we must expect
to find difficulties almost insurmountable to such
limited minds as ours, in the eternal plans and
moral arrangements of the “King Immortal and
Invisible,” as delineated only in their outlines,
in the Sacred Oracles&mdash;particularly those which
relate to the origin of physical and moral evil, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
ultimate destiny of man, and the invisible realities
of a future world.</p>

<p>The <small>UTILITY</small> of the telescope may be considered
in relation to the following circumstances.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be considered as an
instrument or machine which virtually transports
us to the distant regions of space. When we look
at the moon through a telescope which magnifies
200 times, and survey its extensive plains, its lofty
peaks, its circular ranges of mountains, throwing
their deep shadows over the vales, its deep and
rugged caverns, and all the other varieties which
appear on the Lunar surface, we behold such objects
in the same manner as if we were standing
at a point 238,800 miles from the earth in the
direction of the moon, or only twelve hundred
miles from that orb, reckoning its distance to be
240,000 miles. When we view the planet Saturn
with a similar instrument, and obtain a view of
its belts, and satellites, and its magnificent rings,
we are transported, as it were, through regions of
space, to a point in the heavens more than <i>nine
hundred millions of miles</i> from the surface of our
globe, and contemplate those august objects, as if
we were placed within five millions of miles of the
surface of that planet.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Although a supernatural
power, sufficient to carry us in such a celestial
journey, a thousand miles every day, were exerted&mdash;it
would require more than two thousand four
hundred and sixty years, before we could arrive at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
such a distant position; yet the telescope, in a
few moments, transports our visual powers to that
far distant point of space. When we view, with
such an instrument, the minute and very distant
clusters of stars in the Milky Way, we are
carried in effect through the regions of space to
the distance of <i>five hundred thousand millions of
miles</i> from the earth; for we behold those luminaries
through the telescope nearly as if they were
actually viewed from such a distant point in the
spaces of the firmament. These stars cannot be
conceived as less than <i>a hundred billions</i> of miles
from our globe, and the instrument we have supposed
brings them within the two hundredth part
of this distance. Suppose we were carried forward
by a rapid motion towards this point, at the
rate of a thousand miles <i>every hour</i>, it would
require more than <i>fifty-seven thousand years</i>, before
we could reach that very distant station in
space to which the telescope, <i>in effect</i>, transports
us. So that this instrument is far more efficient
in opening to our view the scenes of the universe
than if we were invested with powers of locomotion
to carry us through the regions of space,
with the rapidity of a cannon ball at its utmost
velocity; and all the while we may sit at ease in
our terrestrial apartments.</p>

<p>In the next place, the telescope has been
<i>the means of enlarging our views of the sublime
scenes of creation</i>, more than any other instrument
which art has contrived. Before the invention
of this instrument the universe was generally
conceived as circumscribed within very narrow
limits. The earth was considered as among the
largest bodies in creation; the planets were
viewed as bodies of a far less size than what they
are now found to be; no bodies similar to our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
moon were suspected as revolving around any of
them; and the stars were supposed to be little
more than a number of brilliant lamps hung up to
emit a few glimmering rays, and to adorn the
canopy of our earthly habitation. Such a wonderful
phenomenon as the Ring of Saturn was
never once suspected, and the sun was considered
as only a large ball of fire. It was suspected, indeed,
that the moon was diversified with mountains
and vales, and that it might possibly be a
habitable world; but nothing certainly could be
determined on this point, on account of the limited
nature of unassisted vision. But the telescope
has been the means of expanding our views of the
august scenes of creation to an almost unlimited
extent. It has withdrawn the veil which formerly
interposed to intercept our view of the distant
glories of the sky. It has brought to light five
new planetary bodies, unknown to former astronomers,
one of which is more than eighty times
larger than the earth&mdash;and seventeen <i>secondary</i>
planets which revolve around the primary. It has
expanded the dimensions of the solar system to
double the extent which was formerly supposed.
It has enabled us to descry hundreds of comets
which would otherwise have escaped our unassisted
vision, and to determine some of their trajectories
and periods of revolution.</p>

<p>It has explored the profundities of the Milky
Way, and enabled us to perceive hundreds of
thousands of those splendid orbs, where scarcely
one is visible to the naked eye. It has laid open
to our view thousands of <i>Nebul&aelig;</i>, of various descriptions,
dispersed through different regions of
the firmament&mdash;many of them containing thousands
of separate stars. It has directed our investigations
to thousands of double, treble and multiple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
stars&mdash;suns revolving around suns, and systems
around systems, and has enabled us to determine
some of the periods of their revolutions. It has
demonstrated the immense distances of the starry
orbs from our globe, and their consequent magnitudes;
since it shows us that, having brought
them nearer to our view by several hundreds or
thousands of times, they still appear only as so
many shining <i>points</i>. It has enabled us to perceive
that mighty changes are going forward
throughout the regions of immensity&mdash;new stars
appearing, and others removed from our view, and
motions of incomprehensible velocity carrying forward
those magnificent orbs through the spaces
of the firmament. In short, it has opened a vista
to regions of space so immeasurably distant, that
a cannon ball impelled with its greatest velocity,
would not reach tracts of creation so remote in
two thousand millions of years, and even light itself,
the swiftest body in nature, would require more
than a thousand years before it could traverse this
mighty interval. It has thus laid a foundation for
our acquiring an approximate idea of the infinity
of space, and for obtaining a glimpse of the
far distant scenes of creation, and the immense
extent of the universe.</p>

<p>Again, the telescope, in consequence of the
discoveries it has enabled us to make, has tended
<i>to amplify our conceptions of the attributes and
the Empire of the Deity</i>. The amplitude of our
conceptions of the Divine Being bears a certain
proportion to the expansion of our views in
regard to his works of creation, and the operations
he is incessantly carrying forward throughout
the universe. If our views of the works of God,
and of the manifestations he has given of himself
to his intelligent creatures, be circumscribed to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
narrow sphere, as to a parish, a province, a kingdom,
or a single world, our conceptions of that
Great Being, will be proportionably limited. For
it is chiefly from the manifestation of God in the
material creation that our ideas of his Power, his
Wisdom, and his other natural attributes, are
derived. But in proportion to the ample range
of prospect we are enabled to take of the operations
of the Most High, will be our conceptions of
his character, attributes, and agency. Now, the
telescope&mdash;more than any other invention of man&mdash;has
tended to open to our view the most magnificent
and extensive prospects of the works of
God. It has led us to ascertain that, within the
limits of the solar system, there are bodies which,
taken together, comprise a mass of matter nearly
two thousand five hundred times greater than that
of the earth&mdash;that these bodies are all constituted
and arranged in such a manner as to fit them for
being habitable worlds&mdash;and that the sun, the
centre of this system, is five hundred times larger
than the whole. But, far beyond the limits of this
system, it has presented to our view a universe
beyond the grasp of finite intelligences, and to
which human imagination can assign no boundaries.
It has enabled us to descry suns clustering
behind suns, rising to view in boundless perspective,
in proportion to the extent of its magnifying
and illuminating powers&mdash;the numbers of which
are to be estimated, not merely by thousands,
and tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands,
but by scores of <i>millions</i>&mdash;leaving us no room
to doubt that hundreds of millions more, beyond
the utmost limits of human vision, even when
assisted by art, lie hid from mortal view’s in the
unexplored and unexplorable regions of immensity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span></p>

<p>Here, then, we are presented with a scene which
gives us a display of <i>Omnipotent Power</i> which
no other objects can unfold, and which, without the
aid of the telescope, we should never have beheld&mdash;a
scene which expands our conceptions of the
Divine Being, to an extent which the men of
former generations could never have anticipated&mdash;a
scene which enables us to form an approximate
idea of Him who is the “King Eternal, Immortal,
and Invisible,” who “created all worlds, and for
whose pleasure they are, and were created.” Here
we behold the operations of a Being whose power
is illimitable and uncontrollable, and which far
transcends the comprehension of the highest
created intelligences&mdash;a power, displayed not only
in the vast extension of material existence, and
the countless number of mighty globes which the
universe contains&mdash;but in the astonishingly <i>rapid
motions</i> with which myriads of them are carried
along through the immeasurable spaces of creation,&mdash;some
of those magnificent orbs moving
with a velocity of one hundred and seventy thousand
miles an hour. Here, likewise, we have a
display of the infinite <i>Wisdom</i> and Intelligence of
the Divine Mind, in the harmony and order with
which all the mighty movements of the universe
are conducted&mdash;in proportionating the magnitudes,
motions and distances of the planetary worlds&mdash;in
the nice adjustment of the projectile velocity to
the attractive power&mdash;in the constant proportion
between the times of the periodical revolution of
the planets and the cubes of their mean distances&mdash;in
the <i>distances</i> of the several planets from the
central body of the system, compared with their
respective <i>densities</i>&mdash;and in the constancy and
regularity of their motions, and the exactness
with which they accomplish their destined rounds&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
which circumstances evidently show that He
who contrived the universe is “the only Wise
God,” who is “wonderful in counsel and excellent
in working.” Here, in fine, is a display of
<i>boundless benevolence</i>. For we cannot suppose,
for a moment, that so many myriads of magnificent
globes, fitted to be the centres of a countless
number of mighty worlds, should be nothing else
than barren wastes, without the least relation to
intelligent existence. And if they are peopled
with intellectual beings of various orders&mdash;how
vast must be their numbers, and how overflowing
that Divine Beneficence which has provided for
them all, every thing requisite to their existence
and happiness!</p>

<p>In these discoveries of the telescope, we obtain
a glimpse of the grandeur and the unlimited extent
of God’s universal empire. To this empire
no boundaries can be perceived. The larger, and
the more powerful our telescopes are, the further
are we enabled to penetrate into those distant and
unknown regions; and however far we penetrate
into the abyss of space, new objects of wonder
and magnificence still continue rising to our view&mdash;affording
the strongest presumption, that were
we to penetrate ten thousand times farther into
those remote spaces of immensity, new suns, and
systems, and worlds would be disclosed to our
view. Over all this vast assemblage of material
existence, and over all the sensitive and intellectual
beings it contains, God eternally and unchangably
presides; and the minutest movements,
either of the physical or the intelligent system,
throughout every department of those vast dominions,
are at every moment “naked and open”
to his Omniscient eye. What <i>boundless Intelligence</i>
is implied in the <i>Superintendence</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
<i>arrangement</i> of the affairs of such an unlimited
empire! and what a lofty and expansive idea does
it convey of Him who sits on the throne of Universal
Nature, and whose greatness is unsearchable!
But without the aids of the telescopic tube, we
could not have formed such ample conceptions
of the greatness, either of the Eternal Creator
himself, or of the universe which he hath brought
into existence.</p>

<p>Besides the above, the following uses of the
telescope, in relation to science and common life,
may be shortly noticed:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the business of astronomy, scarcely any
thing can be done with accuracy without the assistance
of the telescope. 1. It enables the astronomer
to determine with precision <i>the transits of
the planets and stars</i>, across the meridian; and
on the accuracy with which these transits are obtained,
a variety of important conclusions and
calculations depend. The computation of astronomical
and nautical tables for aiding the navigator
in his voyages round the globe, and facilitating
his calculations of latitude and longitude, is derived
from observations made by the telescope, without
the use of which instrument, they cannot be made
with precision. 2. The <i>apparent diameters of the
planets</i> can only be measured by means of this
instrument, furnished with a micrometer. By the
naked eye no accurate measurements of the diameters
of these bodies can be taken; and without
knowing their apparent diameters, in minutes or
seconds, their real bulk cannot be determined,
even although their exact distances be known.
The differences, too, between their polar and equatorial
diameters cannot be ascertained without
observations made by powerful telescopes. For
example, the equatorial diameter of Jupiter
is found to be in proportion to the polar as 14
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
to 13, that is, the equatorial is more than 6000
miles longer than the polar diameter, which could
never have been determined by observations made
by the naked eye. 3. The <i>parallaxes</i> of the
heavenly bodies can only be accurately ascertained
by the telescope; and it is only from the knowledge
of their parallaxes, that their distances from
the earth or from the sun can be determined. In
the case of the fixed stars, nothing of the nature
of a parallax could ever be expected to be found
without the aid of a telescope. It was by searching
for the parallax of a certain fixed star, that the
important fact of the <i>Aberration of light</i> was discovered.
The observations, for this purpose, were
made by means of a telescope 24 feet long, fixed
in a certain position. 4. The motions and revolutionary
periods of <i>Sidereal systems</i>, can only be
determined by observations made by telescopes
of great magnifying and illuminating powers.
Without a telescope the small stars which accompany
double or treble stars cannot be perceived,
and much less their motions or variation of their
relative positions. Before the invention of the
telescope such phenomena&mdash;now deemed so wonderful
and interesting&mdash;could never have been
surmised. 5. The accurate determination of the
longitude of places on the earth’s surface is ascertained
by the telescope, by observing with this
instrument the immersions and emersions of the
satellites of Jupiter. From such observations,
with the aid of a chronometer, and having the time
at any known place, the situation of any unknown
place is easily determined. But the eclipses of
Jupiter’s moons can be perceived only by telescopic
instruments of considerable power. 6. By
means of a telescope, with cross hairs in the focus
of the eye-glass, and attached to a Quadrant,
the altitude of the sun or of a star, particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
the pole-star, may be most accurately taken;
and, from such observations, the <i>latitude</i> of
the place may be readily and accurately deduced.</p>

<p>Again, in the <i>Surveying of land</i>, the telescope
is particularly useful; and for this purpose it is
mounted on a stand with a horizontal and vertical
motion, pointing out by divisions the degrees and
minutes of inclination of the instrument. For
the more accurate reading of these divisions, the
two limbs are furnished with a Nonius, or <i>Vernier’s
scale</i>. The object here is to take the
angular distances between distant objects on a
plane truly horizontal; or else the angular elevation
or depression of objects above or below the
plane of the horizon. In order to obtain either
of those kinds of angles to a requisite degree of
exactness, it is necessary that the surveyor should
have as clear and distinct a view as possible of the
objects, or station-staves, which he fixes up for his
purpose, that he may with the greater certainty determine
the point of the object which exactly corresponds
with the line he is taking. Now, as
such objects are generally at too great a distance
for the surveyor to be able to distinguish with the
naked eye, he takes the assistance of the telescope,
by which he obtains, 1. A distinct view of the
object to which his attention is directed, and 2.
he is enabled to determine the precise point of the
object aimed at, by means of the cross hairs in the
focus of the eye-glass. A telescope mounted for
this purpose is called a <i>Theodolite</i>, which is derived
from two Greek words θεομαι <i>to see</i>, and οδος,
<i>the way</i> or <i>distance</i>.</p>

<p>In the next place, the telescope is an instrument
of special importance, in the conducting of
<i>Telegraphs</i>, and in the conveyance of <i>signals</i> of
all descriptions. Without its assistance telegraphic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
dispatches could not be conveyed with accuracy
to any considerable distance, nor in quadruple
the time in which they are now communicated,
and the different stations would need to be exceedingly
numerous. But by the assistance of the
telescope information may be communicated, by a
series of telegraphs, with great rapidity. Twenty-seven
telegraphs convey information from Paris to
Calais&mdash;a distance of 160 miles&mdash;in 3 minutes;
twenty-two from Paris to Lisle in 2 minutes;
forty-six from Strasburg to Paris in 4&frac12; minutes;
and eighty from Paris to Brest in 10 minutes. In
many other cases which occur both on land and
on sea, the telescope is essentially requisite for
descrying signals. The <i>Bell-Rock Light House</i>,
for example, is situated 12 miles from Arbroath,
and from every other portion of land, so that the
naked eye could not discern any signal which
the keepers of that light could have it in their
power to make; but by means of a large telescope
in the station-house in Arbroath, the hoisting
of a ball every morning at 9 <small>A.M.</small>&mdash;which
indicates that ‘All is well’&mdash;may be distinctly
recognised.</p>

<p>Many other uses of this instrument, in the
ordinary transactions of life, will readily occur to
the reader; and therefore I shall only mention
the following purpose to which it may be applied,
namely,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To measure the distance of an object from one
station.</i> This depends upon the increase of the
focal distance of the telescope in the case of near
objects. Look through a telescope at the object
whose distance is required, and adjust the focus
till it appear quite distinct; then slide in the
drawer, till the object begins to be obscure, and
mark that place of the tube precisely. Next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
draw out the tube till the object begins to be
again obscured, and then make another mark as
before. Then take the middle point between
these two marks, and that will be the point where
the image of the object is formed most distinctly;
which is to be nicely measured from the object
lens, and compared with the solar focus of the
lens or telescope, so as to ascertain their difference.
And the rule for finding the distance is,&mdash;‘As
the difference between the focal distance of the
object, and the solar focal distance : Is to the solar
focal distance :: So is the focal distance of the object
: To its true distance from the object lens.’
An example will render this matter more perspicuous.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 84.</i></p>
<img id="fig084" src="images/fig084.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Let AB (fig. 84.) be the object lens, EY the
eye-glass, FC the radius, or focus of the lens AB,
and C<i>f</i> the focal distance of the object OB, whose
distance is to be measured. Now suppose CF =
48 inches, or 4 feet, and that we find by the
above method that C<i>f</i> is 50 inches, then F<i>f</i> is 2
inches; and the analogy is:&mdash;As F<i>f</i> = 2, is to
CF = 48, so is C<i>f</i> = 50, to CQ = 1200 inches,
or 100 feet. Again, suppose C<i>f</i> = 49 inches,
then will F<i>f</i> = 1 inch; and the proportion is,
1 : 48 :: 49 : 2352 = QC, or 196 feet. A telescope
of this focal length, however, will measure
only small distances. But, suppose AB a lens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
whose solar focus is 12 feet, or 144 inches; and
that we find, by the above method, that C<i>f</i>, or
the focal distance of the object, is 146 inches;
then will F<i>f</i> be 2 inches, and the proportion will
be, as 2 : 144 :: 146 : 21024 inches, or 1752
feet = the distance QC. If with such a large
telescope, we view an object OB, and find F<i>f</i>
but <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th of an inch, this will give the distance of the
object as 17292 feet or nearly 3⅓ miles.</p>

<p>Since the difference between the radius of the
object lens and the focal distance of the object is
so considerable as 2 inches in a tube of 4 feet,
and more than 12 inches in one of 12 feet, a
method might be contrived for determining the
distance of near objects by the former, and
more distant objects by the latter, by inspection
only. This may be done by adjusting or drawing
a spiral line round the drawer or tube, through
the <i>two inch space</i> in the small telescope, and by
calculation, graduate it for every 100 feet, and
the intermediate inches, and then, at the same
time we view an object, we may see its distance
on the tube. In making such experiments, a
common object-glass of a long focal length, and
a single eye-glass, are all that is requisite; since
the inverted appearance of the object can cause no
great inconveniency.

<h4 id="ON_THE_METHOD_OF_GRINDING_AND_POLISHING_OPTICAL_LENSES_AND_SPECULA">ON THE METHOD OF GRINDING AND POLISHING OPTICAL LENSES AND SPECULA.</h4>

<p>I originally intended to enter into particular
details on this subject, for the purpose of gratifying
those mechanics and others who wish to amuse
themselves by constructing telescopes and other
optical instruments for their own use; but, having
dwelt so long on the subject of telescopes, in the
preceding pages, I am constrained to confine myself
to a very general sketch.</p>

<p>1. <i>To grind and polish lenses for eye-glasses,
microscopes, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>First provide an upright spindle, at the bottom
of which a pulley is fixed, which must be turned
by a wheel by means of a cord and handle. At
the top of the spindle make a screw the same as a
lathe-spindle, on which you may screw chocks of
different sizes, to which the brass tool in which
the lens is to be ground, may be fixed. Having
fixed upon the breadth and focal length of the
lens, and whether it is to be a plano, or a double
convex&mdash;take a piece of tin-plate or sheet copper,
and, with a pair of compasses, draw an arch upon
its surface, near one of its extremities, with a
radius equal to the focal distance of the lens, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
intended to be double convex, or with half that
distance, if it is to be plano-convex. Remove
with a file that part of the copper which is without
the circular arch, and then a <i>convex</i> gage is
formed. With the same radius strike another
arch, and having removed that part of the copper
which is <i>within</i> it, a <i>concave</i> gage will be obtained.
The brass tool, in which the glass is to be ground,
is then to be fixed upon a turning-lathe, and
turned into a portion of a concave sphere, so as
to correspond to the convex gage. In order to
obtain an accurate figure to the concave tool, a
convex tool of exactly the same radius is generally
formed, and they are ground one upon another
with flour emery; and when they exactly coincide,
they are fit for use. The convex tool will
serve for grinding <i>concave</i> glasses of the same
radius&mdash;and it should be occasionally ground in
the concave tool to prevent it from altering its
figure.</p>

<p>The next thing to be attended to is, to prepare
the piece of glass which is to be ground, by chipping
it in a circular shape, by means of a large
pair of scissors, and removing the roughness from its
edges by a common grind-stone. The faces of the
glass near the edges should likewise be ground on
the grind-stone, till they nearly fit the concave gage,
by which the labour of grinding in the tool will
be considerably saved. The next thing required
is to prepare the emery for grinding, which is
done in the following manner. Provide four or
five clean earthen vessels; fill one of them with
water, and put into it a pound or half a pound of
fine emery, and stir it about with a stick; after
which let it stand 3 or 4 seconds, and then pour
it into another vessel, which may stand about 10
seconds; then pour it off again into the several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
vessels till the water is quite clear; and by this
means, emery of different degrees of fineness is
obtained, which must be kept separate from each
other, and worked in their proper order, beginning
at the first, and working off all the marks
of the grind-stone; then take of the second, next
of the third, &amp;c.,&mdash;holding the glass upon the pan
or tool with a light hand, when it comes to be
nearly fit for polishing. The glass in this operation
should be cemented to a wooden handle, by means
of pitch or other strong cement. After the finest
emery has been used, the roughness which remains
may be taken away, and a slight polish given by
grinding the glass with pounded pumice-stone.
Before proceeding to the polishing, the glass
should be ground as smooth as possible, and all
the scratches erased, otherwise the polishing will
become a tedious process. The polishing is performed
as follows: Tie a piece of linen rag or of
fine cloth about the tool, and with fine putty,
(calcined tin), or colcothar of vitriol (a very fine
powder, sometimes called the red oxide of iron)
moistened with water, continue the grinding motion,
and in a short time there will be an excellent
polish.</p>

<p>In order to grind lenses very accurately for the
finest optical purposes, particularly object-glasses
for telescopes&mdash;the concave tool is firmly fixed to
a table or bench, and the glass wrought upon it
by the hand with circular strokes so that its centre
may never go beyond the edges of the tool. For
every 6 or 7 circular strokes, the glass should receive
2 or 3 cross ones along the diameter of the
tool, and in different directions; and while the
operation is going on, the convex tool should, at
the end of five minutes, be wrought upon the
concave one for a few seconds, in order to preserve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
the same curvature to the tools and to the
glass. The finest polish is generally given in the
following way. Cover the concave tool with a
layer of pitch hardened by the addition of a little
rosin, to the thickness of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>15</sub>th of an inch. Then,
having taken a piece of thin writing paper, press
it upon the surface of the pitch with the convex
tool, and pull the paper quickly from the pitch
before it has adhered to it; and if the surface of
the pitch is marked every where with the lines of
the paper, it will be truly spherical. If any
paper remains on the surface of the pitch, it may
be rubbed off by soap and water, and if the marks
of the paper should not appear on any part of it,
the operation must be repeated, till the polisher
or bed of pitch is accurately spherical. The glass
is then to be wrought on the polisher by circular
and cross strokes with the putty or colcothar, till
it has received a complete polish. When one side
is finished, the glass must be separated from its
handle, by inserting the point of a knife between
it and the pitch, and giving it a gentle stroke.
The pitch which remains upon the glass may be
removed by rubbing it with a little oil or spirits
of wine. The operation of polishing on cloth is
slower, and the polish less perfect than on pitch;
but it is a mode best fitted for those who have
little experience, and who would be apt, in the
first instance, to injure the figure of the lens by
polishing it on a bed of pitch.</p>

<p>2. <i>On the method of casting and grinding the
Specula of Reflecting Telescopes.</i></p>

<p>The first thing to be considered in the formation
of reflecting telescopes, is the <i>composition</i> of the
metal of which the specula are made. The qualities
required are&mdash;a sound uniform metal, free
from all microscopic pores&mdash;not liable to tarnish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
by absorption of moisture from the atmosphere&mdash;not
so hard as to be incapable of taking a good
figure and polish&mdash;nor so soft as to be easily
scratched, and possessing a high reflecting power.
Various compositions have been used for this purpose,
of which the following are specimens:&mdash;Take
good Swedish copper 32 ounces, and when
melted, add 14&frac12; ounces of grain tin to it; then,
having taken off the scoria, cast it into an ingot.
This metal must be a second time melted to cast a
speculum; but it will fuse in this compound state
with a small heat, and therefore will not calcine
the tin to putty. It should be poured off as soon
as it is melted, giving it no more heat than is absolutely
necessary. The best method for giving the
melted metal a good surface is this: the moment
before it is poured off, throw into the crucible a
spoonful of charcoal-dust; immediately after which
the metal must be stirred with a wooden spatula
and poured into the moulds.&mdash;The following is
another composition somewhat similar. Take 2
parts copper as pure as it is possible to procure;
this must be melted in a crucible by itself. Then
put, in another crucible, 1 part of pure grain tin.
When they are both melted, mix and stir them
with a wooden spatula, keeping a good flux on the
melted surface to prevent oxidation, and then pour
the metal quickly into the moulds, which may be
made of founder’s loam.</p>

<p>The composition suggested, more than half a
century ago, by the Rev. Mr. Edwards, has often
been referred to with peculiar approbation. This
gentleman took a great deal of pains to discover
the best composition, and to give his metals a fine
polish and the true parabolical figure. His telescopes
were tried by Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer
Royal, who found them greatly to excel in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
brightness, and to equal in other respects those
made by the best artists. They showed a white
object perfectly white, and all objects of their
proper colour. He found, after trying various
combinations, the following to be the best: namely
32 ounces of copper, with 15 or 16 ounces of grain
tin, (according to the purity of the copper) with
the addition of one ounce of brass, one of silver,
and one ounce of arsenic. This, he affirms, will
form a metal capable, when polished in a proper
manner, of reflecting more light than any other
metal yet made public.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. Little, in his observations on this
subject in the ‘Irish Transactions,’ proposes the
following composition, which he found to answer
the purpose better than any he had tried, namely&mdash;32
parts of best bar copper, previously fluxed
with the black flux, of two parts tartar and one
of nitre, 4 parts brass, 16 parts tin, and 1&frac14;
arsenic. If the metal be granulated, by pouring
it, when first melted, into water, and then fused
a second time, it will be less porous than at first.
In this process, the chief object is, to hit on the
exact point of the saturation of the copper, &amp;c.,
by the tin. For, if the latter be added in too
great quantity, the metal will be dull coloured
and soft; if too little, it will not attain the most
perfect whiteness, and will certainly tarnish.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>When the metal is cast, and prepared by the
common grind-stone for receiving its proper
figure&mdash;the gages and grinding-tools are to be
formed in the same manner as formerly described
for lenses, with this difference, that the radius of
the gages must always be <i>double</i> the focal length
of the speculum, as the focus of parallel rays by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
reflection is at one half the radius of concavity.
In addition to the concave and convex tools&mdash;which
should be only a little broader than the
metal itself&mdash;a convex elliptical tool of lead and
tin should be formed with the same radius, so that
its transverse should be to its conjugate diameter
as 10 to 9, the latter being exactly equal to the
diameter of the metal. The grinding of the
speculum is then to be commenced, on this tool,
with coarse emery powder and water, when the
roughness is taken off, by moving the speculum
across the tool, in different directions, walking
round the post on which the tool is fixed, holding
the speculum by the wooden handle to which it is
cemented. It is then to be wrought with great
care on the convex brass tool, with circular and
cross strokes, and with emery of different degrees&mdash;the
concave tool being sometimes ground upon
the convex one, to keep them all of the same
radius, and when every scratch is removed from
its surface, it will be fit for receiving the final
polish.</p>

<p>When the metal is ready for polishing, the
elliptical tool is to be covered with black pitch
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>th of an inch thick, and the polisher formed
in the same way as in the case of lenses, either
with the concave brass tool or with the metal
itself. The colcothar of vitriol should then be
triturated between two surfaces of glass, and a
considerable quantity of it applied at first to the
surface of the polisher. The speculum is then to
be wrought, in the usual way, upon the polishing
tool, till it has received a brilliant lustre, taking
care to use no more of the colcothar, if it can be
avoided, and only a small quantity of it, if it
should be found necessary. When the metal
moves stiffly on the polisher, and the colcothar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
assumes a dark muddy hue, the polish advances
with great rapidity. The tool will then grow
warm, and would probably stick to the speculum,
if its motion were discontinued for a moment. At
this stage of the process, therefore, we must proceed
with great caution, breathing continually on
the polisher, till the friction is so great, as to
retard the motion of the speculum. When this
happens, the metal is to be slipped off the tool at
one side, cleaned with soft leather, and placed in a
tube for the purpose of trying its performance;
and if the polishing has been conducted with care,
it will be found to have a true <i>parabolic</i> figure.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>It was formerly the practice, before the speculum
was brought to the polisher, to smooth it on
a <i>bed of hones</i>, or a convex tool made of the best
blue stone, such as clockmakers use in polishing their
work, which was made one fourth part larger than
the metal which was to be ground upon it, and
turned as true as possible to a gage. But this tool
is not generally considered as absolutely necessary,
except when silver and brass enter into the
composition of the metal, in order to remove
the roughness which remains after grinding with
the emery.</p>

<p><i>To try the figure of the metal.</i>&mdash;In order to this,
the speculum must be placed in the tube of the
telescope for which it is intended; and, at about
20 or 30 yards distant, there should be put up a
watch-paper, or similar object, on which there are
some very fine strokes of an engraver. An annular
kind of diagram should be made with card-paper,
so as to cover a circular portion of the
middle part of the speculum, between the hole
and the circumference, equal in breadth to about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of its diameter. This paper ring should be
fixed in the mouth of the telescope, and remain so
during the whole experiment. There must likewise
be two other circular pieces of card-paper
cut out, of such sizes, that one may cover the
centre of the metal, by completely filling the hole
in the annular piece now described: and the
other such a round piece as shall exactly fill the
tube, and so broad as that the inner edge just
touches the outward circumference of the middle
annular piece. All these pieces together will
completely shut up the mouth of the telescope.
Let the round piece which covers the centre of
the metal be removed, and adjust the instrument
so that the image may be as sharp and distinct as
possible. Then replace the central piece, and
remove the outside annular one, by which means
the circumference only of the speculum will be
exposed; and the image now formed will be from
the rays reflected from the exterior side of the
metal. If the two images formed by these two
portions of the metal be perfectly sharp and
equally distinct, the speculum is perfect and of
the true parabolic curve. If, on the contrary, the
image from the outside of the metal should not be
distinct and that it should be necessary to bring
the little speculum <i>nearer</i> by the screw, the metal
is not yet brought to the parabolic figure; but if,
in order to procure distinctness, we be obliged to
move the small speculum farther off, then the
figure of the great speculum has been carried
beyond the parabolic, and has assumed the hyperbolic
form.</p>

<p><i>To adjust the eye-hole of Gregorian Reflectors.</i>&mdash;If
there is only one eye-glass, then the distance
of the small hole should be as nearly as possible
equal to its focal length. But in the compound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
Huygenian eye-piece, the distance of the eye-hole
may be thus found:&mdash;Multiply the difference
between the focal distance of the glass next to the
speculum, and the distance of the two eye-glasses,
by the focal distance of the glass nearest the eye;
divide the product by the sum of the focal distances
of the two lenses, lessened by their distance,
and the quotient will be the compound
focal distance required. Thus, if the focal distance
of the lens next the speculum be 3 inches,
that of the lens next the eye 1 inch, and their
distance 2 inches, then the compound focal distance
from the eye-glass will be (3 - 2 &times; 1)/(3 &times; 1 - 2) = &frac12; inch.&mdash;The
<i>diameter</i> of the eye-hole is always equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the diameter of
the great speculum by the magnifying power of
the telescope. It is generally from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of an
inch in diameter. It is necessary, in many cases,
to obtain, <i>from direct experiment</i>, an accurate
determination of the place and size of the eye-hole,
as on this circumstance depends, in a certain
degree, the accurate performance of the instrument.</p>

<p><i>To center the two specula of Gregorian Reflectors.</i>&mdash;Extend
two fine threads or wires across the
aperture of the tube at right angles, so as to
intersect each other, exactly in the axis of the
telescope. Before the arm is finally fastened to
the slider, place it in the tube, and through the
eye-piece (without glasses) the intersection of the
cross wires must be seen exactly in the centre
of the hole of the arm. When this exactness is
obtained, let the arm be firmly riveted and soldered
to the slider.</p>

<p><i>To centre lenses.</i>&mdash;The centering of lenses is of
great importance, more especially for the object-glasses
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
of achromatic instruments. The following
is reckoned a good method:&mdash;Let the lens to be
centered be cemented on a brass chuck, having
the middle turned away so as not to touch the
lens, but near the edge, which will be hid when
mounted. This rim is very accurately turned flat
where it is to touch the glass. When the chuck
and cement is warm it is made to revolve rapidly:
while in motion a lighted candle is brought before
it, and its reflected image attentively watched. If
this image has any motion, the lens is not flat or
central; a piece of soft wood must therefore be
applied to it in the manner of a turning tool, till
such time as the light becomes stationary. When
the whole has cooled, the edges of the lens must
be turned by a diamond, or ground with emery.</p>

<p>A micrometer is an instrument attached to a
telescope, in order to measure small spaces in
the heavens, such as the spaces between two stars,
and the diameters of the sun, moon and planets&mdash;and
by the help of which the <i>apparent magnitude</i>
of all objects viewed through telescopes may be
measured with great exactness.</p>

<p>There are various descriptions of these instruments,
constructed with different substances, and
in various forms, of which the following constitute
the principal variety. The <i>Wire</i> micrometer&mdash;the
<i>Spider’s line</i> micrometer&mdash;the Polymetric reticle&mdash;Divided
<i>object glass</i> micrometer&mdash;Divided
<i>eye-glass</i> micrometer&mdash;Ramsden’s <i>Catoptric</i>
micrometer&mdash;Rochon’s <i>crystal</i> micrometer&mdash;Maskelyne’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
<i>Prismatic</i> micrometer&mdash;Brewster’s <i>micrometrical
telescope</i>&mdash;Sir W. Herschel’s <i>Lamp</i>
micrometer&mdash;Cavallo’s <i>Mother of Pearl</i> micrometer,
and several others. But, instead of attempting
even a general description of these instruments,
I shall confine myself merely to a very
brief description of <i>Cavallo’s Micrometer</i>, as its
construction will be easily understood by the
general reader, as it is one of the most simple of
these instruments, and is so cheap as to be procured
for a few shillings; while some of the
instruments now mentioned are so expensive, as
to cost nearly as much as a tolerably good telescope.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>This micrometer consists of a thin and narrow
slip of mother of pearl finely divided, which is
placed in the focus of the eye-glass of a telescope,
just where the image of the object is formed; and
it may be applied either to a reflecting or a refracting
telescope, provided the eye-glass be a
convex lens. It is about the 20th part of an inch
broad, and of the thickness of common writing
paper, divided into equal parts by parallel lines,
every fifth and tenth of which is a little longer
than the rest. The simplest way of fixing it is
to stick it upon the diaphragm which generally
stands within the tube, and in the focus of the
eye-glass. When thus fixed, if you look through
the eye-glass, the divisions of the micrometrical
scale will appear very distinct, unless the diaphragm
is not exactly in the focus of the eye-glass, in
which case it must be moved to the proper place;&mdash;or,
the micrometer may be placed exactly in
the focus of the eye-lens by the interposition of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
a circular piece of paper, card, or by means of
wax. If a person should not like to see always
the micrometer in the field of the telescope, then
the micrometrical scale, instead of being fixed to
the diaphragm, may be fitted to a circular perforated
plate of brass, of wood, or even of paper,
which may be occasionally placed upon the said
diaphragm. One of these micrometers, in my
possession, which contains 600 divisions in an
inch, is fitted up in a separate eye-tube, with a
glass peculiar to itself, which slides into the eye-piece
of the telescope, when its own proper glass
is taken out.</p>

<p><i>To ascertain the value of the divisions of this
micrometer.</i>&mdash;Direct the telescope to the sun, and
observe how many divisions of the micrometer
measure its diameter exactly. Then take out of
the Nautical Almanack the diameter of the sun
for the day on which the observation is made.
Divide it by the above-mentioned number of divisions,
and the quotient is the value of one division
of the micrometer. Thus, suppose that 26&frac12; divisions
of the micrometer measure the diameter of
the sun, and that the Nautical Almanack gives for
the measure of the same diameter 31&acute;: 22&acute;&acute;, or
1882&acute;&acute;. Divide 1882 by 26.5, and the quotient is
71&acute;&acute; or 1&acute;: 11&acute;&acute;, which is the value of one division
of the micrometer; the double of which is the
value of two divisions, and so on. The value of
the divisions may likewise be ascertained by the
passage of an equatorial star over a certain number
of divisions in a certain time. The stars best
situated for this purpose are such as the following&mdash;δ
in the Whale, R. A. 37&deg;: 3⅓&acute;, Dec. 37&acute;: 50&acute;&acute;
S; δ in Orion, R. A. 80&deg;: 11&acute;: 42&acute;&acute;, Dec. 28&acute;: 40&acute;&acute;
S; υ in the Lion, R. A. 171&deg;: 25&acute;: 21&acute;&acute;, Dec. 23&acute;:
22&acute;&acute; N.; η in Virgo R. A. 182&deg;: 10&acute;, Dec. 33&acute;: 27&acute;&acute;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
N. But the following is the most easy and
accurate method of determining the value of the
divisions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mark upon a wall or other place the length of
<i>six inches</i>, which may be done by making two
dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing a six
inch ruler upon a stand. Then place the telescope
before it, so that the ruler or six-inch length
may be at right angles with the direction of the
telescope, and just 57 feet 3&frac12; inches distant from
the object-glass of the telescope; this done, look
through the telescope at the ruler, or other extension
of six inches, and observe how many divisions
of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same
number of divisions is equal to half a degree, or
30&acute;; and this is all that is necessary for the required
determination. The reason of which is,
because an extension of six inches subtends an
angle of 30&acute;, at the distance of 57 feet, 3&frac12; inches,
as may be easily calculated from the rules of plane
Trigonometry.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 85.</i></p>
<img id="fig085" src="images/fig085.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Fig. 85, exhibits this micrometer scale, but
shows it four times larger than the real size of
one which was adapted to a 3 feet achromatic telescope
magnifying 84 times. The divisions upon
it are the 200ths of an inch, which reach from
one edge of the scale to about the middle of it,
excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are
longer. Two divisions of this scale are very nearly
equal to one minute; and as a quarter of one of
these divisions may be distinguished by estimation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
therefore an angle of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of a minute, or of 7&frac12;&acute;&acute; may
be measured with it. When a telescope magnifies
more, the divisions of the micrometer must be
more minute. When the focus of the eye-glass
of the telescope is shorter than half an inch, the
micrometer may be divided with the 500ths of an
inch; by means of which, and the telescope magnifying
about 200 times, one may easily and accurately
measure an angle smaller than half a second.
On the other hand, when the telescope does not
magnify above 30 times, the divisions need not be
so minute. In one of Dollond’s pocket telescopes,
which, when drawn out for use is only 14 inches
long, a micrometer with the hundredths of an inch
is quite sufficient, and one of its divisions is equal
to little less than 3 minutes, so that an angle of a
minute may be measured by it. Supposing 11&frac12;
of those divisions equal to 30&acute; or 23 to a degree&mdash;any
other angle measured by any other number of
divisions, is determined by proportion. Thus,
suppose the diameter of the sun, seen through the
same telescope, be found equal to 12 divisions, say
As 11&frac12; divisions : are to 30 minutes :: so are 12
divisions : to ((12 &times; 30)/11.5) 31.3, which is the required
diameter of the sun.</p>

<p><i>Practical uses of this Micrometer.</i>&mdash;This micrometer
may be applied to the following purposes:&mdash;1.
For measuring the apparent diameters of the
sun, moon, and planets. 2. For measuring the
apparent distances of the satellites from their primaries.
3. For measuring the cusps of the moon
in eclipses. 4. For measuring the apparent distances
between two contiguous stars&mdash;between a
star and a planet&mdash;between a star and the moon&mdash;or
between a comet and the contiguous stars, so as
to determine its path. 5. For finding the difference
of declination of contiguous stars, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
they have nearly the same R. Ascension. 6. For
measuring the small elevations or depressions of
objects above and below the horizon. 7. For
measuring the proportional parts of buildings, and
other objects in perspective drawing. 8. For
ascertaining whether a ship at sea, or any moving
object is coming nearer or going farther off; for if
the angle subtended by the object appears to increase,
it shows that the object is coming nearer, and
if the angle appears to decrease, it indicates that the
object is receding from us. 9. For ascertaining
the real distances of objects of known extension,
and hence to measure heights, depths, and horizontal
distances. 10. For measuring the real extensions
of objects when their distances are known.
11. For measuring the distance and size of an
object when neither of them is known.</p>

<p>When the micrometer is adapted to those telescopes
which have four glasses in the eye-tube&mdash;and
<i>when the eye-tube only is used</i>, it may be
applied to the following purposes:&mdash;1. For measuring
the real or lineal dimensions of small objects,
instead of the angles. For if the tube be
unscrewed from the rest of the telescope, and
applied to small objects, it will serve for a microscope,
having a considerable magnifying power, as we
have already shown, (p. 348); and the micrometer,
in that case, will measure the lineal dimensions of
the object, as the diameter of a hair, the length
of a flea, or the limbs of an insect. In order to
find the value of the divisions for this purpose,
we need only apply a ruler, divided into tenths of
an inch, to the end of the tube, and, looking
through the tube, observe how many divisions of
the micrometer measure one tenth of an inch on
the ruler, which will give the required value.
Thus, if 30 divisions are equal to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th of an inch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
300 of them must be equal to 1 inch, and one
division is equal to the 300dth part of an inch.
2. For measuring the magnifying power of other
telescopes. This is done by measuring the diameter
of the pencil of light at the eye-end of the telescope
in question. For, if we divide the diameter of the
object lens by the diameter of this pencil of light,
the quotient will express how many times that
telescope magnifies in diameter. Thus, suppose
that 300 divisions of the micrometer are equal to
the apparent extension of 1 inch&mdash;that the pencil
of light is measured by 4 of these divisions&mdash;and
that the diameter of the object lens measures 1
inch and 2 tenths:&mdash;Multiply 1.2 by 300, and the
product 360, divided by 4, gives 90 for the magnifying
power of the telescope.</p>

<p><i>Problems which may be solved by this micrometer.</i>
I. The angle&mdash;not exceeding one degree&mdash;which
is subtended by an extension of 1 foot,
being given, to find its distance from the place of
observation:&mdash;Rule 1. If the angle be expressed
in minutes, say, as the given angle : is to 60 :: so
is 687.55 : to a fourth proportional, which gives
the answer in inches. 2. If the angle be expressed
in seconds, say, As the given angle : is to 3600 ::
so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional, which expresses
the answer in inches. 3. If the angle be
expressed in minutes and seconds, turn it all into
seconds, and proceed as above. Example, at what
distance is a globe of 1 foot in diameter, when it
subtends an angle of 2 seconds? 2 : 3600 :: 687.55 :
(3600 &times; 687.55)/2 = 1237596 inches, or 103132&frac12; feet
= the answer required. II. The angle which is
subtended by any known extension being given, to
find its distance from the place of observation.
Rule, Proceed as if the extension were of one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
foot, by Problem I, and call the answer B; then if
the extension in question be expressed in inches,
say, as 12 inches : are to that extension :: so is
B : to a fourth proportional, which is the answer
in inches. But if the extension in question be
expressed in feet, then we need only multiply it
by B, and the product is the answer in inches.&mdash;Example,
At what distance is a man 6 feet high,
when he appears to subtend an angle of 30&acute;&acute;?
By Problem I, if the man were 1 foot high, the
distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is 6
feet high, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the
product is the required distance, namely 495036
inches, or 41253 feet.</p>

<p>For greater conveniency, especially in travelling,
when one has not the opportunity of making
such calculations, the following two tables have
been calculated; the first of which shows the distance
answering to any angle from one minute to
one degree, which is subtended by a man whose
height is considered an extension of 6 feet, because
at a mean, such is the height of a man when
dressed with hat and shoes on. These tables may
be transcribed on a card, and may be kept always
ready with a pocket telescope furnished with a
micrometer. Their use is to ascertain distances
without any calculations; and they are calculated
only to minutes, because with a pocket telescope
and micrometer, it is not possible to measure an
angle more accurately than to a minute. Thus,
if we want to measure the extension of a street,
let a foot ruler be placed at the end of the street;
measure the angular appearance of it, which suppose
to be 36&acute;, and in the table we have the required
distance against 36&acute;, which is 95&frac12; feet.
Thus also a man who appears to be 49&acute; high, is at
the distance of 421 feet. Again, Suppose the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
trunk of a tree which is known to be 3 feet in
diameter be observed to subtend an angle of 9&acute;&frac12;.
Take the number answering to 9&acute; out of the table,
namely 382, and subtract from it a proportional
part for the half minute, namely 19.1, which
subtracted from 382, leaves 362.9. This multiplied
by 3, the diameter of the tree, produces
1087.7 feet = the distance from the object end
of the telescope.</p>

<p>In this way the distance of a considerably remote
object, as a town or building at 10 or 12
miles distant, may be very nearly determined;
provided we have the lineal dimensions of a house
or other object that stands at right angles to the
line of vision. The breadth of a river, of an arm
of the sea, or the distance of a light house, whose
elevation above the sea or any other point, is
known, may likewise in this manner be easily
determined.

<h4 id="ON_THE_EQUATORIAL_TELESCOPE">ON THE EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE, OR PORTABLE OBSERVATORY.</h4>

<p>The equatorial instrument is intended to answer
a number of useful purposes in Practical Astronomy,
independently of any particular observatory.
Besides answering the general purpose of a Quadrant,
a Transit instrument, a Theodolite, and an
Azimuth instrument&mdash;it is almost the only instrument
adapted for viewing the stars and planets <i>in
the day-time</i>, and for following them in their
apparent diurnal motions. It may be made use
of in any steady room or place, and performs
most of the useful problems in astronomical
science.</p>

<p>The basis of all equatorial instruments is a
revolving axis, placed parallel to the axis of the
earth, by which an attached telescope is made to
follow a star or other celestial body in the arc of its
diurnal revolution, without the trouble of repeated
adjustments for changes of elevation, which quadrants
and circles with vertical and horizontal axes
require. Such an instrument is not only convenient
for many useful and interesting purposes
in celestial observations, but is essentially requisite
in certain cases, particularly in examining
and measuring the relative positions of two contiguous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
bodies, or in determining the diameters
of the planets, when the spider’s-line micrometer
is used.</p>

<p>Christopher Scheiner is supposed to have been
the first astronomer who, in the year 1620, made
use of a polar axis, but without any appendage of
graduated circles. It was not, however, till the
middle of the last century, that any instruments
of this description, worthy of the name, were
attempted to be constructed. In 1741, Mr.
Henry Hindley, a clock-maker in York, added to
the polar axis, an equatorial plate, a quadrant of
altitude, and declination semicircle; but when
this piece of mechanism was sent to London for
sale in 1748, it remained unsold for the space of
13 years. Mr. Short, the optician, published in
the Philosophical Transactions, for 1750, a ‘description
of an equatorial telescope,’ which was of
the reflecting kind, and was mounted over a combination
of circles and semicircles, which were
strong enough to support a tube, and a speculum
of the Gregorian construction 18 inches in focal
length. This instrument consisted of a somewhat
cumbersome and expensive piece of machinery&mdash;a
representation of which may be seen in volume
III of Martin’s ‘<i>Philosophia Britannica</i>, or
system of the Newtonian philosophy.’ Various
modifications of this instrument have since been
made by Nairne, Dollond, Ramsden, Troughton,
and other artists; but even at the present period,
it has never come into very general use, though it
is one of the most pleasant and useful instruments
connected with astronomical observations.</p>

<p>As many of these instruments are somewhat
complicated, and very expensive, I shall direct
the attention of the reader solely to one which I
consider as the most simple&mdash;which may be purchased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
at a moderate expence, and is sufficiently
accurate for <i>general</i> observations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 86.</i></p>
<img id="fig086" src="images/fig086.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This instrument consists of the following parts:
A <i>horizontal circle</i> EF (fig. 86.) divided into four
quadrants of 90 degrees each. There is a fixed
nonius at N; and the circle is capable of being
turned round on an axis. In the centre of the
horizontal circle is fixed a strong upright pillar,
which supports the centre of a vertical semicircle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
AB, divided into two quadrants of 90 degrees
each. This is called the <i>semicircle of altitude</i>,
and may, at any time, serve the purpose of a
quadrant in measuring either altitudes or depressions.
It has a nonius plate at K. At right
angles to the plane of this semicircle, the <i>equatorial
circle</i> MN is firmly fixed. It represents
the equator, and is divided into twice 12 hours,
every hour being divided into 12 parts of 5
minutes each. Upon the equatorial circle moves
another circle, with a chamfered edge, carrying a
nonius by which the divisions on the equatorial
may be read off to single minutes; and at right
angles to this moveable circle is fixed the <i>semicircle
of declination</i> D, divided into two quadrants
of 90 degrees each. The telescope PO, is surmounted
above this circle, and is fixed to an index
moveable on the semicircle of declination, and
carries a nonius opposite to Q. The telescope is
furnished with 2 or 3 Huygenian eye-pieces, and
likewise with a diagonal eye-piece for viewing
objects near the zenith. Lastly, there are 2
spirit levels fixed on the horizontal circle, at right
angles to each other, by means of which this
circle is made perfectly level when observations
are to be made.</p>

<p><i>To adjust the equatorial for observation.</i> Set
the instrument on a firm support. Then <i>to adjust
the levels and the horizontal circle</i>:&mdash;Turn the
horizontal circle till the beginning O of the divisions
coincides with the middle stroke of the
nonius, or near it. In this situation one of the
levels will be found to lie either in a right line
joining the 2 foot screws which are nearest the
nonius, or else parallel to such a right line. By
means of the 2 last screws, cause the bubble in
the level to become stationary in the middle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
the glass; then turn the horizontal circle half
round, by bringing the other O to the nonius;
and if the bubble remains in the middle, as before,
the level is well-adjusted; if it does not, correct
the position of the level, by turning one or both
of the screws which pass through its ends, till the
bubble has moved half the distance it ought to
come to reach the middle, and cause it to move
the other half by turning the foot-screws already
mentioned. Return the horizontal circle to its
first position, and if the adjustments have been
well made, the bubble will remain in the middle:
if otherwise, the process must be repeated till it
bears this proof of its accuracy. Then turn the
horizontal circle till 90&deg; stands opposite to the
nonius; and by the foot-screw,immediately opposite
the other 90&deg;, cause the bubble of the same
level to stand in the middle of the glass. Lastly,
by its own proper screws set the other level so
that its bubble may occupy the middle of its glass.</p>

<p><i>To adjust the line of sight.</i> Set the nonius on
the <i>declination</i> semicircle at O, the nonius on the
horary circle at VI, and the nonius on the semicircle
of altitude at 90. Look through the telescope
towards some part of the horizon, where
there is a diversity of remote objects. Level the
horizontal circle, and then observe what object
appears in the centre of the cross-wires, or in the
centre of the field of view, if there be no wires.
Reverse the semicircle of altitude, so that the
other 90&deg; may apply to the nonius; taking care,
at the same time, that the other three noniuses
continue at the same parts of their respective
graduations as before. If the remote object continues
to be seen on the centre of the cross-wires,
the line of sight is truly adjusted.</p>

<p><i>To find the correction to be applied to observations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
by the semicircle of altitude.</i> Set the nonius
on the declination-semicircle to 0, and the nonius
on the horary circle to XII; direct the telescope
to any fixed and distant object, by moving the
horizontal circle and semicircle of altitude, and
nothing else; note the degree and minute of altitude
or depression; reverse the declination-semicircle,
by directing the nonius on the horary circle
to the opposite XII; direct the telescope again
to the same object, by means of the horizontal
circle and semicircle of altitude, as before. If its
altitude or depression be the same as was observed
in the other position, no correction will be required;
but, if otherwise, half the difference of
the two angles is the correction to be added to all
observations made with that quadrant, or half of
the semicircle which shows the least angle, or to
be subtracted from all the observations made with
the other quadrant, or half of the semicircle.
When the levels and other adjustments are once
truly made, they will be preserved in order for
a length of time, if not deranged by violence;
and the correction to be applied to the semicircle
of altitude is a constant quantity.</p>

<p><i>Description of the nonius.</i> The nonius&mdash;sometimes
called the <i>vernier</i>&mdash;is a name given to a
device for subdividing the arcs of quadrants and
other astronomical instruments. It depends on
the simple circumstance, that if any line be
divided into equal parts, the length of each part
will be greater, the fewer the divisions; and contrariwise,
it will be less in proportion as those
divisions are more numerous. Thus, in the
equatorial now described, the distance between
the two extreme strokes on the nonius is exactly
equal to 11 degrees on the limb, but that it is
divided into 12 equal parts. Each of these last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
parts will therefore be shorter than the <i>degree</i> on
the limb in the proportion of 11 to 12, that is to
say, it will be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub>th part, or 5 minutes shorter.
Consequently, if the middle stroke be set precisely
opposite to any degree, the relative positions
of the nonius and the limb must be altered
5 minutes of a degree, before either of the two
adjacent strokes next the middle on the nonius,
can be brought to coincide with the nearest stroke
of a degree; and so likewise the second stroke on
the nonius will require a change of 10 minutes,
the third of 15, and so on to 30, when the middle
line of the nonius will be seen to be equi-distant
between 2 of the strokes on the limb; after which
the lines on the opposite side of the nonius will
coincide in succession with the strokes on the
limb. It is clear from this, that whenever the
middle stroke of the nonius does not stand precisely
opposite to any degree, the odd minutes&mdash;or
distance between it and the degree immediately
preceding&mdash;may be known by the <i>number</i> of the
stroke marked on the nonius, which coincides
with any of the strokes on the limb.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> In some
instruments the nonius-plate has its divisions
fewer than the number of parts on the limb to
which it is equal; but when once a clear idea of
the principle of any nonius is obtained, it will be
easy to transfer it to any other mode in which this
instrument is contrived.</p>

<p><i>To find by this equatorial the</i> <small>MERIDIAN LINE</small>,
and the time, <small>FROM ONE OBSERVATION OF THE
SUN</small>. In order to this it is requisite that the
sun’s declination, and the latitude of the place be
known. The declination of the sun may be
found, for every day, in the Nautical Almanack,
or any other astronomical Ephemeris; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
latitude of the place may be found by means of
the semicircle of altitude, when the telescope is
directed to the sun or a known fixed star. It is
likewise requisite to make the observation when
the azimuth and altitude of the sun alter quickly;
and this is generally the case, the farther that
luminary is from the meridian:&mdash;Therefore, at
the distance of 3 or 4 hours, either before or after
noon, (in summer) adjust the horizontal circle;
set the semicircle of altitude, so that its nonius
may stand at the co-latitude of the place; lay the
plane of the last-mentioned semicircle in the
meridian, by estimation, its 0 being directed
towards the depressed pole; place the nonius of
the declination semicircle to the declination,
whether north or south. Then direct the telescope
towards the sun, partly by moving the
declination semicircle on the axis of the equatorial
circle, and partly by moving the horizontal circle
on its own axis. There is but one position of
these which will admit of the sun being seen exactly
in the middle of the field of view. When
this position is obtained, the nonius on the equatorial
circle shows <i>the apparent time</i>, and <i>the
circle of altitude is in the plane of the meridian</i>.
When this position is ascertained, the meridian
may be settled by a land-mark at a distance.</p>

<p>With an equatorial instrument, nearly similar
to that now described, I formerly made a series
of ‘<i>day observations</i> on the celestial bodies,’
which were originally published in vol. 36 of
‘Nicholson’s Journal of Natural Philosophy,’ and
which occupy twenty pages of that journal. Some
of these observations I shall lay before the reader,
after having explained the manner in which they
are made.</p>

<p>The instrument was made by Messrs. W. and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
S. Jones, opticians, Holborn, London. The
telescope which originally accompanied the instrument
was an achromatic refractor, its object-glass
being 8&frac12; inches focal distance, and one inch
diameter. This telescope, not admitting sufficiently
high magnifying powers for the observations
intended, was afterwards thrown aside for
another telescope, having an object-glass 20 inches
focal length, and 1&frac34; inch diameter, which was
attached to the equatorial machinery in place of
the small telescope. It was furnished with magnifying
powers of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100 times.
The instrument was placed on a firm pedestal
about three feet high. The feet of this pedestal
had short iron pikes, which slipped into corresponding
holes in the floor of the apartment adjacent
to a south window, so that when the direction
of the meridian was found, and the circles
properly adjusted, the instrument was in no
danger of being shifted from this position. Though
this instrument generally stood fronting the
southern part of the heavens, yet the equatorial
part, along with the telescope, could occasionally
be removed to another position fronting the north
and north-west, for observing the stars in those
quarters.</p>

<p><i>Manner of observing stars and planets in the
day-time by the equatorial.</i> Before such observations
can be made, the semicircle of altitude must
be placed in the meridian, and the degree and
minute pointed out by the nonius on the horizontal
circle, when in this position, noted down in a
book, so that it may be placed again in the same
position, should any derangement afterwards
happen. The semicircle of altitude must be set
to the co-latitude of the place; that is, to what
the latitude wants of 90&deg;. Suppose the latitude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
of the place of observation be 52&deg; 30&acute; north, this
latitude subtracted from 90&deg;, leaves 37&deg; 30&acute; for
the co-latitude; and therefore, the semicircle of
altitude&mdash;on which the equatorial circle is fixed&mdash;must
be elevated to 37&deg; 30&acute;, and then the equatorial
circle on the instrument coincides with the
equator in the heavens. Lastly, the telescope
must be adjusted on the declination semicircle, so
as exactly to correspond with the declination of
the heavenly body to be viewed. If the body is
in the equator, the telescope is set by the index
at 0 on the semicircle of declination, or at the
middle point between the two quadrants, and
then when the telescope, along with the semicircle
of declination, is moved from right to left,
or the contrary, it describes an arc of the equator.
If the declination of the body be north, the telescope
is elevated to the northern division of the
semicircle; if south, to the southern part of it.</p>

<p>These adjustments being made, take the difference
between the Right Ascension of the sun
and the body to be observed; and if the Right
Ascension of the body be greater than that of the
sun, subtract the difference from the time of observation;
if not, add to the time of observation.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
The remainder in one case, or the sum in the
other, will be the hour and minute to which the
nonius on the equatorial circle is to be set; which
being done, the telescope will point to the star or
planet to whose declination the instrument is adjusted.
When the heavenly body is thus found,
it may be followed, in its diurnal course, for hours,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
or as long as it remains above the horizon. For
as the diurnal motion of a star is parallel to the
equator, the motion of the telescope on the equatorial
circle, will always be in the star’s diurnal
arc; and should it have left the field of the telescope
for any considerable time, it may be again recovered,
by moving the telescope onward according
to the time which elapsed since it was visible
in the field of view. We may illustrate what has
been now stated by an example or two. Suppose
on the 30th April, 1841, at 1 o’clock, <small>P.M.</small> we
wished to see the star <i>Aldebaran</i>. The Right
Ascension of this star is 4<sup>h</sup> 27<sup>m</sup>; and the sun’s
Right Ascension for that day at noon, as found
in ‘White’s Ephemeris,’ or the ‘Nautical Almanack,’
is 2<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>. Subtract this last number from
4<sup>h</sup> 27<sup>m</sup>, and the remainder 1<sup>h</sup> 57<sup>m</sup>, shows that the
star comes to the meridian on that day at 57
minutes past 1 o’clock, <small>P.M.</small> And as the time of
observation is 1 <small>P.M.</small>, the nonius which moves on
the equatorial circle must be set to 3 minutes past
XI, as the star is at that hour 57 minutes from the
meridian. The declination of Aldebaran is 16&deg;
11&acute; north, to which point on the semicircle of declination,
the telescope must be adjusted, and
then the star will be visible in the field of view.
Again, suppose we wished to observe the planet
Venus on the 1st January, 1842, at 12 o’clock
noon. The sun’s Right Ascension on that day
is 18<sup>h</sup> 46<sup>m</sup>, and that of Venus 17<sup>h</sup> 41<sup>m</sup>, from
which the sun’s Right Ascension being subtracted,
the remainder is 22<sup>h</sup> 55<sup>m</sup>, or 55 minutes past 10,
<small>A.M.</small> Here, as the Right Ascension of Venus is
too small to have the sun’s Right Ascension taken
from it, we borrow 24 hours, and reckon the
remainder from XII at noon. As the planet at
12 noon, is 1 hour 5 minutes past the meridian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
the nonius on the equatorial circle must be set to
that point, and the telescope adjusted to 23&deg; 6&acute; of
south declination, which is the declination of
Venus for that day, when this planet will appear
in the field of view.</p>

<h4 id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_THE_FIXED_STARS_AND_PLANETS"><i>Observations on the fixed stars and planets, made
in the day-time by the Equatorial.</i></h4>

<p>For the purpose of illustrating the descriptions
now given, and for affording some information
respecting celestial day observations, I shall select
a few of the observations above alluded to, which I
formerly published in Nicholson’s Journal, along
with a few others which have been since made.
These observations were made with a view to
determine the following particulars:&mdash;1. What
stars and planets may be conveniently seen in the
day-time, when the sun is above the horizon?
2. What degrees of magnifying power are requisite
for distinguishing them? 3. How near their
conjunction with the sun they may be seen? and
4. Whether the diminution of the aperture of
the object-glass of the telescope, or the increase of
magnifying power, conduces most to render a star
or a planet visible in day-light. Having never
seen such observations recorded in books of astronomy
or in scientific journals, I was induced to
continue them, almost every clear day for nearly a
year, in order to determine the points now specified.
Some of the results are stated in the following pages.</p>

<p><i>Observations on fixed stars of the first magnitude.</i>
April 23, 1813, at 10<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup>, <small>A.M.</small>, the sun
being 5&frac12; hours above the horizon. Saw the star
<i>Vega</i>, or α Lyr&aelig;, very distinctly with a power of
30 times. Having contracted the aperture of the
object-glass to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of an inch, saw it on a darker
ground, but not more plainly than before.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
Having contracted the aperture still farther, to
half an inch, I perceived the star, but not so
distinctly as before. The sky being very clear,
and the star in a quarter of the heavens nearly
opposite to the sun, I diminished the magnifying
power to 15, and could still perceive the star, but
indistinctly; it was just perceptible. August 23,
at 0<sup>h</sup> 12<sup>m</sup>, <small>P.M.</small>, saw the star <i>Capella</i>, or α
<i>Aurig&aelig;</i>, with a power of 60, and immediately
afterwards with a power of 30; the aperture undiminished.
With this last power it appeared
extremely distinct, but not so brilliant and splendid
as with the former power. Having diminished
the aperture to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of an inch, it appeared on a
darker ground, though in the former case, it was
equally perceptible. A few minutes afterwards,
could distinguish it with a power of 15, the aperture
being contracted to half an inch. It appeared
very small; it was with difficulty the eye could
fix upon it in the field of the telescope; but when
it was once perceived, its motion across the field
of view could be readily followed. It could not be
perceived, when the diminished aperture was removed.
The sun was then shining in meridian splendour.</p>

<p>August 10th, 9<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>, <small>A.M.</small> Saw the star Sirius
with a power of 60, the aperture contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
inch. Saw it likewise when the aperture was
diminished to half an inch, but not so distinctly
as through the aperture of inch. Having put
on a power of 30, could distinguish it distinctly
enough through each of the former apertures, and
likewise when they were removed; but somewhat
more distinctly with the apertures of nine-tenths
and half an inch than without them. At this
time the star was 2<sup>h</sup> 42<sup>m</sup> in time of Right Ascension
west of the sun, having an elevation above
the horizon of about 17&deg; 10’; the sun shining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
bright, and the sky very much enlightened in that
quarter of the heavens where the star appeared.
There was also a considerable undulation of the
air, which is generally the case in the hot mornings
of summer&mdash;which renders a star more difficult
to be perceived than in the afternoon,
especially when it is viewed at a low altitude.
June 4th, 1<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>, <small>P.M.</small>, saw Sirius with a power
of 30 with great distinctness, the aperture not
contracted. The star was then within 1<sup>h</sup> 50<sup>m</sup>, in
time of Right Ascension east from the sun.
August 24th, 9<sup>h</sup> 5<sup>m</sup>, <small>A.M.</small>, saw the star <i>Procyon</i>,
or α <i>Canis-Minoris</i> distinctly with a power of 60,
the aperture not contracted. When diminished
to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch, it appeared rather more distinct, as the
ground on which it was seen was darker. With a
power of 30, and the aperture contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub>
inch, could perceive it, but somewhat indistinctly.
When the equatorial motion was performed, in
order to keep it in the field of view, it was sometime
before the eye could again fix upon it.
When the aperture was diminished to half an inch,
it could not be perceived. Saw it when both the
apertures were removed, but rather more distinctly
with the aperture of <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch. The difference
in the result of this observation, from that of
Capella, above stated, was owing to the star’s
proximity to the sun, and the consequent illumination
of the sky in that quarter where it appeared.
Its difference in Right Ascension from
that of the sun was then about 2<sup>h</sup> 5<sup>m</sup> of time, and
its difference of declination about 4&deg; 50&acute;.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
star may be considered as one of those which rank
between the first and second magnitudes.</p>

<p>Similar observations to the above were made
and frequently repeated on the stars Rigel,
Aldebaran, Betelguese Cor-Leonis and other
stars of the first magnitude, which gave nearly
the same results. The stars Altares and Fomalhaut
are not so easily distinguished, on account
of their great southern declination, and consequent
low elevation above the horizon. The
following observation on <i>Arcturus</i> may be added.
June 3rd, observed Arcturus very distinctly, a
little before 7 in the evening, the sun being about
1<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup> above the horizon, and shining bright&mdash;with
a power of 15; the aperture not contracted.
It appeared very small but distinct. This star is
easily distinguishable at any time of the day with
a power of 30.</p>

<p><i>Observations on stars of the second magnitude.</i>
May 5, 1813, at 6<sup>h</sup>, <small>P.M.</small>; the sun being an hour
and three quarters above the horizon. Saw
<i>Alphard</i>, or α Hydr&aelig;, a star of the second magnitude,
with a power of 60; the aperture
diminished to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch. A few minutes afterwards
could perceive it, but indistinctly, with a power
of 30, the aperture contracted as above. It could
not be seen very distinctly with this power, till
about half an hour before sun-set. It was then
seen rather more distinctly when the aperture was
contracted than without the contraction. May
7th. Saw the star <i>Deneb</i>, or β <i>Leonis</i>, distinctly
with a power of 60, about an hour and a half before
sun-set. August 20th. Saw Ras Alkague,
or α <i>Ophiuchi</i>, at 4<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup>, <i>P.M.</i>, with a power of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
100, the sun being nearly 3 hours above the horizon,
and shining bright. Perceived it about an
hour afterwards, with a power of 60&mdash;with the
aperture contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch, and also when this
contraction was removed. The star was seen nearly
as distinctly in the last case as in the first. August
27, 5<sup>h</sup>, <i>P.M.</i>, the same star appeared quite distinct
with a power of 60, the aperture not contracted. It
did not appear more distinct when the aperture
was contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch. The sun was then
more than 2 hours above the horizon. August
28th. Saw the star <i>Pollux</i>, or β <i>Gemini</i>, 2 hours
after sun-rise with a power of 60, aperture undiminished.
November 12th, 1<sub>h</sub> 30&acute;, <i>P.M.</i> Saw the
star <i>Altair</i>, or α <i>Aquil&aelig;</i>, with an 8&frac12; inch telescope,
1 inch aperture, carrying a power of 45, the
aperture not contracted. Having contracted the
aperture a little, it appeared somewhat less distinct.
This star is reckoned by some to belong
to the class of stars of the first magnitude; but in
White’s ‘Ephemeris’ and other Almanacks, it
is generally marked as being of the second magnitude.
It forms a kind of medium between stars
of the 1st and of the 2nd magnitude.</p>

<p>Similar observations, giving the same results,
were made on the stars Bellatrix, Orion’s Girdle,
α Andromed&aelig;, α Pegasi, Alioth, Benetnasch,
North Crown, or α Coron&aelig; Borealis, and various
other stars of the same magnitude.</p>

<p>From the above and several hundreds of similar
observations, <i>the following conclusions</i> are deduced.</p>

<p>1. That a magnifying power of 30 times is
sufficient for distinguishing a fixed star of the
first magnitude, even at noon-day, at any season
of the year; provided it have a moderate degree
of elevation above the horizon, and be not within
30&deg; or 40&deg; of the sun’s body. Also, that, by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
magnifying power of 15, a star of this class may
be distinguished, when the sun is not above an
hour and a half above the horizon. But, in every
case, higher powers are to be preferred. Powers
of 45 or 60, particularly the last, were found to
answer best in most cases, as with such powers
the eye could fix on the star with ease, as soon as
it entered the field of the telescope.</p>

<p>2. That most of the stars of the 2nd magnitude
may be seen with a power of 60, when the sun is
not much more than 2 hours above the horizon;
and, at any time of the day, the brightest
stars of this class may be seen with a power of
100, when the sky is serene, and the star not
too near the quarter in which the sun appears.</p>

<p>3. That, in every instance, an increase of magnifying
power has the principal effect in rendering
a star easily perceptible. That diminution of
aperture, in most cases, produces a very slight
effect; in some cases, none at all; and, when the
aperture is contracted beyond a certain limit, it
produces a hurtful effect. The cases in which a
moderate contraction is useful, are the two following:&mdash;1.
When the star appears in a bright part
of the sky, not far from that quarter in which the
sun appears. 2. When an object-glass of a large
aperture, and a small degree of magnifying power,
is used. In almost every instance the contraction
of the object-glass of the 8&frac12;-inch telescope
with a power of 45, had a hurtful effect. But
when the 20-inch telescope carried a power of
only 15, the contraction served to render the
object more perceptible.</p>

<h4 id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_THE_PLANETS_IN_THE_DAY_TIME"><i>Observations on the Planets made in the day-time.</i></h4>

<p>Some of the planets are not so easily distinguished
in the day-time as the fixed stars of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
first magnitude. The one which is most easily
distinguished at all times, is the planet Venus.</p>

<p>1. <i>Observations on Venus.</i> My observations on
this planet commenced about the end of August,
1812, about three or four weeks after its inferior
conjunction. About that period, between ten
and eleven in the forenoon, with a power of 45,
it appeared as a beautiful crescent, quite distinct
and well-defined, with a lustre similar to that of
the moon about sun-set, but of a whiter colour.
The view of its surface and phase was fully more
distinct and satisfactory than what is obtained in
the evening after sun-set; for, being at a high
elevation, the undulation near the horizon did
not affect the distinctness of vision. The planet
was then very distinctly seen with a power of 7
times, when it appeared like a star of the first or
second magnitude. I traced the variation of its
phases, almost every clear day, till the month of
May, 1813. As at that time, it was not far from
its superior conjunction with the sun, I wished
to ascertain how near its conjunction with that
luminary it might be seen; and particularly
whether it might not be possible, in certain cases,
to see it at the moment of its conjunction.</p>

<p>The expressions of all astronomical writers previous
to this period, when describing the phases
of Venus, either directly assert, or, at least imply,
that it is <i>impossible</i> to see that planet, in any
instance, at the time of its superior conjunction.
This is the language of Dr. Long, Dr. Gregory,
Dr. Brewster, Ferguson, Adams, B. Martin,
and most other writers on the science of astronomy.
How far such language is correct will appear
from the following observations and remarks.</p>

<p>April 24, 1813, 10<sup>h</sup> 50&acute; <small>A.M.</small> Observed Venus
with a power of 30, the aperture not contracted.
She was then about 31 minutes, in time, of right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
ascension, distant from the sun. Their difference
of declination 3&deg; 59&acute;. She appeared distinct and
well-defined. With a power of 100, could distinguish
her gibbous phase. May 1st, 10<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup>,
<small>A.M.</small> Viewed this planet with a power of 60;
the aperture not contracted. It appeared distinct.
Saw it about the same time with a power
of 15, the aperture being contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch.
Having contracted the aperture to &frac12; inch, saw it
more distinctly. When the contracted apertures
were removed, the planet could with difficulty be
distinguished, on account of the direct rays of the
sun striking on the inside of the tube of the telescope.
The sun was shining bright, and the
planet about 25&acute; of time in R.A. west of his centre,
their difference of declination being 3&deg; 7&acute;.
May 7th, 10<sup>h</sup>, <small>A.M.</small> Saw Venus distinctly with a
power of 60, the sun shining bright. It was then
about 19&acute; in time of R.A. and 4&deg; 27&acute; in longitude
west of the sun; their difference of declination
being 2&deg; 18&acute;. I found a diminution of aperture
particularly useful when viewing the planet at this
time, even when the higher powers were applied.
This was the last observation I had an opportunity
of making prior to the conjunction of Venus
with the sun, which happened on May 25th, at
9<sup>h</sup> 30<sup>m</sup>, <small>A.M.</small> Its geocentric latitude at that time
being about 16&acute; south, the planet must have passed
almost close by the sun’s southern limb. Cloudy
weather for nearly a month after the last observation,
prevented any further views of the planet,
when it was in that part of the heavens which
was within the range of the instrument. The
first day that proved favourable after it had passed
the superior conjunction, was June 5th. The
following is the memorandum of the observation
then taken.</p>

<p>June 5th, 9<sup>h</sup>, <small>A.M.</small> Adjusted the Equatorial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Telescope for viewing the planet Venus, but it
could not be perceived, on account of the direct
rays of the sun entering the tube of the telescope.
I contrived an apparatus for screening his
rays, but could not get it conveniently to move
along with the telescope; and therefore determined
to wait till past eleven, when the top of the
window of the place of observation would intercept
the solar rays. At 11<sup>h</sup> 20<sup>m</sup>, <small>A.M.</small>, just as
the sun had passed the line of sight from the eye
to the top of the window, and his body was
eclipsed by it, I was gratified with a tolerably distinct
view of the planet, with a power of 60.
The aperture being contracted to <sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch. The
distinctness increased as the sun retired, till, in
two or three minutes, the planet appeared perfectly
well-defined. Saw it immediately afterwards,
with a power of 30, the aperture contracted
as before. Saw it also quite distinctly with a
power of 15; but it could not be distinguished
with this power, when the contracted aperture
was removed. At this time Venus was just
3&deg; in longitude, or about 13&acute; in time of R.A. east
of the sun’s centre, and of course only about
2&frac34; degrees from his eastern limb; the difference of
their declination being 27&acute;, and the planet’s latitude
11&acute; north.</p>

<p>Several years afterwards, I obtained views of
this planet, when considerably nearer the sun’s
margin than as stated in the above observation,
particularly on the 16th October, 1819, when
Venus was seen when only 6 days and 19 hours
past the time of the superior conjunction. At
that time its distance from the sun’s eastern limb
was only 1&deg; 28&acute; 42&acute;&acute;. A subsequent observation
proved that Venus can be seen when only 1&deg; 27&acute;,
from the sun’s margin&mdash;which I consider as approximating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
to the nearest distance from the sun
at which this planet is distinctly visible.&mdash;I
shall only state farther the two or three following
observations.</p>

<p>June 7th, 1813, 10<sup>h</sup>, <small>A.M.</small> Saw Venus with
a power of 60, the aperture being contracted to
<sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch&mdash;the direct rays of the sun <i>not being intercepted
by the top of the window</i>. The aperture
having being further contracted to &frac12; inch, could
perceive her, but not quite so distinctly. When
the contractions were removed, she could scarcely
be seen. She was then 3&deg; 33&acute; in longitude, and
nearly 15 minutes in time of R.A. distant from
the sun’s centre. Some fleeces of clouds having
moved across the field of view, she was seen remarkably
distinct in the interstices&mdash;the sun at
the same time, being partly obscured by them.&mdash;August
19th, 1<sup>h</sup> 10&acute;, <small>P.M.</small> Viewed Venus with a
magnifying power of 100. Could perceive her
surface and gibbous phase almost as distinctly as
when the sun is below the horizon. She appeared
bright, steady in her light, and well defined, without
that glare and tremulous appearance she exhibits
in the evening when near the horizon. She
was then nearly on the meridian. On the whole,
such a view of this planet is as satisfactory, if not
preferable, to those views we obtain with an
ordinary telescope in the evening, when it is visible
to the naked eye.</p>

<p>All the particulars above stated have been confirmed
by many subsequent observations continued
throughout a series of years. I shall state only
two recent observations which show that Venus
may be seen somewhat nearer the sun than what
is deduced from the preceding observations, and at
the point of its superior conjunction. March 10th,
1842, observed the planet Venus, then very near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
the sun, at 19 minutes past 11, <small>A.M.</small> It had
passed the point of its superior conjunction with
the sun, on the 5th March, at 1<sup>h</sup> 19<sup>m</sup>, <small>P.M.</small> The
difference of right ascension between the sun and
the planet was then about 6&frac12; minutes of time, or
about 1&deg; 37&frac12;&acute;, and it was only about 1&deg; 21&acute; distant
from the sun’s eastern limb. It appeared quite
distinct and well-defined, and might perhaps have
been seen on the preceding day, had the observation
been then made.&mdash;The following observation
shows that Venus may be seen still nearer the
sun than in the preceding observations, and even
<i>at the moment of its superior</i> conjunction. On
the 2nd of October, 1843, this planet passed the
point of its superior conjunction with the sun, at
4<sup>h</sup> 15<sup>m</sup>, <small>P.M.</small> At two o’clock, <small>P.M.</small>&mdash;only two hours
before the conjunction, I perceived the planet distinctly,
and kept it in view for nearly ten minutes,
till some dense clouds intercepted the view. It
appeared tolerably distinct and well-defined, though
not brilliant, and with a round full face, and its
apparent path was distinctly traced several times
across the field of view of the telescope. I perceived
it afterwards, about half past four, <small>P.M.</small>,
only a few minutes after it had passed the point
of conjunction, on which occasion it appeared less
distinct than in the preceding observation, owing
to the low altitude of the planet, being then only
a few degrees above the horizon. The observations,
in this instance, were made not with an equatorial
instrument, which I generally use in such
observations, but with a good achromatic telescope
44&frac12; inches focal distance, mounted on a common
tripod, with a terrestrial power of 95 times. A
conical tube about ten inches long was fixed on
the object-end of the telescope, at the extremity
of which an aperture, 1&frac12; inch diameter was placed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
so as to intercept, as much as possible, the direct
ingress of the solar rays. The top of the upper
sash of the window of the place of observation
was likewise so adjusted as to intercept the greater
part of the sun’s rays from entering the tube of the
telescope. The sun’s declination at that time was
3&deg; 26&acute; south, and that of Venus 2&deg; 12&acute; south; consequently,
the difference of declination was 1&deg;
14&acute; = the distance of Venus from the sun’s centre;
and as the sun’s diameter was about 16&acute;,
Venus was then only 58&acute; from the sun’s northern
limb, or 6&acute; less than two diameters of the sun.</p>

<p>This is the nearest approximation to the sun at
which I have ever beheld this planet, and it demonstrates
that Venus may be seen even when
within a degree of the sun’s margin; and it is
perhaps the nearest position to that luminary in
which this planet can be distinctly perceived. It
shows that the light reflected from the surface
of Venus is far more brilliant than that reflected
from the surface of our moon; for no trace of this
nocturnal luminary can be perceived, even when
at a much greater distance from the sun, nor is
there any other celestial body that can be seen
within the limit now stated. This is the first observation,
so far as my information extends, of
Venus having been seen at the time of her
superior conjunction.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>The practical conclusion from this observation
is, that, at the superior conjunction of this planet,
when its distance from the sun’s margin is not less
than 58&acute;, <i>its polar and equatorial diameter may
be measured</i> by a micrometer, when it will be
determined whether or not Venus be of a <i>spheroidal</i>
figure. The Earth, Mars, Jupiter and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
Saturn are found to be not spheres but <i>spheroids</i>,
having their polar shorter than their equatorial
diameters. But the true figure of Venus has
never yet been ascertained, because it is only at
the superior conjunction that she presents a full
enlightened hemisphere, and when both diameters
can be measured, except at the time when she
transits the sun’s disk, which happens only twice
in the course of 120 years.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span></p>

<p>The following conclusions are deduced from the
observations made on Venus.</p>

<p>1. That this planet may be seen distinctly, with
a moderate degree of magnifying power, <i>at the
moment of its superior conjunction with the sun</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
when its geocentric latitude, either north or south,
at the time of conjunction, is not less than 1&deg; 14&acute;,
or, when the planet is about 58&acute; from the sun’s
limb. This conclusion is deduced from the observation
of Oct. 2, 1843,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> stated above.</p>

<p>2. Another conclusion is&mdash;that during the space
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
of 583 days, or about 19 months&mdash;the time this
planet takes in moving from one conjunction with
the sun to a like conjunction again&mdash;when its
latitude at the time of its superior conjunction
exceeds 1&deg; 14&acute;, it may be seen with an equatorial
telescope every clear day without interruption,
except about the period of its <i>inferior</i> conjunction,
when its dark hemisphere is turned towards
the earth, and a short time before and after it.
When its geocentric latitude is less than 1&deg; 14&acute;, it
will be hid only about four days before, and the
same time after its superior conjunction. During
the same period it will be invisible to the naked
eye, and consequently no observations can be
made upon it with a common telescope, for nearly
six months, and sometimes more, according as its
declination is north or south, namely about
two or three months before, and the same time
after its superior conjunction, except where there
is a very free and unconfined horizon. In regard
to the time in which this planet can be hid about
the period of its <i>inferior</i> conjunction, I have
ascertained from observation, that it can never be
hid longer than during a space of 2 days 22 hours;
having seen Venus, about noon, like a fine slender
crescent, only 35 hours after she had passed the
point of her inferior conjunction; and in a late
instance she was seen when little more than a day
from the period of conjunction. The longest
time, therefore, that this planet can be hid from
view during a period of 583 days, is only about
10 days; and when its latitude at the time of
the superior conjunction, equals or exceeds
1&deg; 14&acute;, it can be hid little more than two days.
This is a circumstance which cannot be affirmed of
any other celestial body, the sun only excepted.</p>

<p>3. That every variation of the phases of this
planet&mdash;from a slender crescent to a full enlightened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
hemisphere&mdash;may, on every clear day, be
conveniently exhibited by means of the equatorial
telescope. This circumstance renders this instrument
peculiarly useful in the instruction of the
young in the principles of astronomy. For, if the
phase which Venus should exhibit at any particular
time be known, the equatorial telescope may be
directed to the planet, and its actual phase in the
heavens be immediately exhibited to the astronomical
pupil.</p>

<p>4. Since it is only at the period of the superior
conjunction that this planet presents a full
enlightened hemisphere, and since it is only when
this phase is presented that both its diameters
can be measured&mdash;it is of some importance that
observations be made on it at the moment of
conjunction, by means of powerful telescopes furnished
with micrometers, so as to determine the
difference (if any) between its polar and equatorial
diameters.</p>

<p>5. Another conclusion from the observations
on Venus, is, that a moderate diminution of the
aperture of the object-glass of the telescope is
useful, and even necessary in viewing this planet
when near the sun. Its effect is owing in part
to the direct solar rays being thereby more effectually
excluded; for when these rays enter
directly into the tube of the telescope, it is very
difficult, and almost impossible to perceive this
planet, or any other celestial body when in the
vicinity of the sun.</p>

<h4 id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_JUPITER_AND_OTHER_PLANETS"><i>Observations on Jupiter and other planets.</i></h4>

<p>This planet is very easily distinguished in the
day-time with a very moderate magnifying power,
when it is not within 30&deg; or 35&deg; of the sun. The
following extract from my memorandums may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
serve as a specimen. May 12, 1813, 1<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup>, <small>P.M.</small>
Saw Jupiter with a power of 15 times, the aperture
not contracted. The planet appeared so
distinct with this power, that I have reason to believe,
it would have been perceived with a power
of 6 or 7 times. When the aperture was contracted
<sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch, and afterwards to half an inch, there
was little perceptible difference in its appearance.
It was then about 58&deg; in longitude, east of the
sun.</p>

<p>Though Jupiter when at a considerable distance
from the sun, and near his opposition, appears to
the naked eye with a brilliancy nearly equal to
that of Venus, yet there is a very striking difference
between them, in respect of lustre, when
viewed in day-light. Jupiter, when viewed with a
high magnifying power, in the day-time, always
exhibits a very dull cloudy appearance; whereas
Venus appears with a moderate degree of splendour.
About the end of June 1813, between 5
and 6 in the evening, having viewed the planet
Venus, then within 20&deg; of the sun, and which
appeared with a moderate degree of lustre, I
directed the telescope to Jupiter, at that time
more than 32&deg; from the sun, when the contrast
between the two planets was very striking, Jupiter
appearing so faint as to be just discernible, though
his apparent magnitude was nearly double that of
Venus. In this observation a power of 65 was
used. In his approach towards the sun, about the
end of July, I could not perceive him when he
was within 16&deg; or 17&deg; of his conjunction with that
luminary.&mdash;<i>These circumstances furnish a sensible
and popular proof</i>, independently of astronomical
calculations, <i>that the planet Jupiter is placed at a
much greater distance from the sun than Venus</i>;
since its light is so faint as to be scarcely perceptible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
when more than 20 degrees from the sun,
while that of Venus is distinctly seen amidst the
full splendour of the solar rays, when only about
a degree from the margin of that luminary.
With a power of 65 I have been enabled to distinguish
the <i>belts</i> of Jupiter before sun-set, but
could never perceive any of his satellites till the
sun was below the horizon. There are no observations
which so sensibly and strikingly indicate
the different degrees of light emitted by the different
planets as those which are made in the day-time.
To a common observer, during night,
Jupiter and Venus appear, in a clear sky, nearly
with equal brilliancy, and even Mars, when about
the point of his <i>opposition</i> to the sun, appears
with a lustre somewhat similar, though tinged
with a ruddy hue; but when seen in day-light
their aspect is very dissimilar. This circumstance
evidently indicates, 1. that these planets are placed
at different distances from the sun, and consequently
are furnished with different degrees of
light proportional to the square of their distances
from that luminary;&mdash;and 2. that there are certain
circumstances connected with the surfaces and
atmospheres of the planetary bodies, which render
the light they emit more or less intense, independently
of their different distances from the central
luminary. For Mars, though much nearer to the
sun than Jupiter, is not so easily distinguished in
the day-time, and, even in the night-time, appears
with a less degree of lustre.</p>

<p>My observations on <i>Saturn</i> in day-light, have
not been so frequent as those on Jupiter. I have
been enabled to distinguish his ring several times
before sun-set, with a power of 65; but his great
southern declination, and consequent low altitude,
at the periods when these observations were made,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
were unfavourable for determining the degree of
his visibility in day-light; for a planet or a star is
always more distinctly perceptible in a <i>high</i> than
in a low altitude, on account of the superior purity
of the atmosphere through which a celestial object
is seen when at a high elevation above the horizon.
This planet, however, is not nearly so distinctly
visible in day-light as Jupiter, and I have
chiefly seen it, when the sun was not more than
an hour or two above the horizon, but never at
noon-day; although it is probable that with
powerful instruments it may be seen even at that
period of the day. The planet <i>Mars</i> is seldom
distinctly visible in the day-time, except when at
no great distance from its opposition to the sun.
The following is a memorandum of an observation
on Mars, when in a favourable position. October
24, 1836. Saw the planet Mars distinctly with a
power of about 60, at 40 minutes past 9 <small>A.M.</small>, the
sun having been above the horizon nearly three
hours. It appeared tolerably distinct, but scarcely
so brilliant as a fixed star of the first magnitude,
but with apparently as much light as Jupiter
generally exhibits when viewed in day-light. It
could not be traced longer at the time, so as to
ascertain if it could be seen at mid-day; on
account of the interposition of the western side
of the window of the place of observation. The
ruddy aspect of this planet&mdash;doubtless caused by
a dense atmosphere with which it is environed&mdash;is
one of the causes which prevents its appearing
with brilliancy in the day-time. With respect
to the planet <i>Mercury</i>, I have had opportunities
of observing it several times after sun-rise, and
before sun-set, about 10 or 12 days before and
after its greatest elongation from the sun, with a
power of 45. I have several times searched for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
this planet about noon, but could not perceive it.
The air, however, at the times alluded to, was not
very clear, and I was not certain that it was within
the field of the telescope; and therefore, I am
not convinced but that, with a moderately high
power, it may be seen even at noon-day.</p>

<p>Such are some specimens of the observations I
have made on the heavenly bodies in the day-time,
and the conclusions which may be deduced from
them. I have been induced to communicate them,
from the consideration, that the most minute
facts, in relation to any science, are worthy of
being known, and may possibly be useful. They
may at least gratify the astronomical tyro with
some information which he will not find in the
common treatises on astronomy, and may perhaps
excite him to prosecute a train of similar observations
for confirming or correcting those which have
been noted above.</p>

<p>Besides the deductions already stated, the following
general conclusions may be noted.&mdash;1.
That a celestial body may be as easily distinguished
at noon-day, as at any time between the hours of
nine in the morning and three in the afternoon,
except during the short days in winter. 2. They
are more easily distinguished at a high than at a
low altitude&mdash;in the afternoon than in the morning,
especially if their altitudes be low&mdash;and in
the northern region of the heavens than in the
southern. The difficulty of perceiving them at a
low altitude is obviously owing to the thick
vapours near the horizon. Their being less easily
distinguished in the morning than in the afternoon
is owing to the undulations of the atmosphere,
which are generally greater in the morning than
in the afternoon. This may be evidently perceived
by looking at distant land-objects at those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
times, in a hot day, through a telescope which
magnifies about 40 or 50 times, when they will be
found to appear tremulous and distorted in consequence
of these undulations, especially if the sun
be shining bright. In consequence of this circumstance,
we can seldom use a high terrestrial
power with effect on land objects, except early in
the morning, and a short time before sun-set.
Their being more easily distinguished in the
northern region of the heavens is owing to that
part of the sky being of a deeper azure, on
account of its being less enlightened than the
southern with the splendour of the solar rays.</p>

<h4 id="UTILITY_OF_CELESTIAL_DAY_OBSERVATIONS"><i>Utility of Celestial Day Observations.</i></h4>

<p>The observations on the heavenly bodies in the
day-time, to which I have now directed the attention
of the reader, are not to be considered as
merely gratifications of a rational curiosity, but
may be rendered subservient to the promotion of
astronomical science. As to the planet Venus&mdash;when
I consider the degree of brilliancy it exhibits,
even in day-light, I am convinced that useful
observations might frequently be made on its surface
in the day-time, to determine some of its
physical peculiarities and phenomena. Such observations
might set at rest any disputes which
may still exist respecting the period of rotation of
this planet. Cassini, from observations on a bright
spot, which advanced 20&deg; in 24<sup>h</sup> 34<sup>m</sup> determined
the time of its rotation to be 23 hours, 20 minutes.
On the other hand, Bianchini, from similar observations,
concluded that its diurnal period was 24
days and 8 hours. The difficulty of deciding
between these two opinions, arises from the short
time in which observations can be made on this
planet, either before sun-rise, or after sun-set,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
which prevents us from tracing, with accuracy,
the progressive motion of its spots for a sufficient
length of time. And, although an observer should
mark the motion of the spots at the same hour,
on two succeeding evenings, and find they had
moved forward about 15&deg; in 24 hours, he would
still be at a loss to determine, whether they had
moved only 15&deg;, in all, since the preceding observation,
or had finished a revolution and 15&deg; more.
If, therefore, any spots could be perceived on the
surface of Venus in the day-time, their motion
might be traced, when she is in north declination,
for 12 hours or more, which would completely
settle the period of rotation. That it is not improbable
that spots, fitted for this purpose, may
be discovered on her disk in the day-time, appears
from some of the observations of Cassini, who
saw one of her spots when the sun was more than
eight degrees above the horizon.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The most distinct
and satisfactory views I have ever had of this
planet were those which I obtained in the day-time,
in summer, when it was viewed at a high
altitude, with a 44&frac12; inch achromatic telescope,
carrying a power of 150. I have at such times
distinctly perceived the distinction between the
shade and colour of its margin, and the superior
lustre of its central parts, and some spots have
occasionally been seen, though not so distinctly
marked as to determine its rotation. Such distinct
views are seldom to be obtained in the evening
after sun-set, on account of the undulations of
the atmosphere, and the dense mass of vapours
through which the celestial bodies are viewed
when near the horizon.</p>

<p>Nor do I consider it altogether improbable that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
its <i>satellite</i> (if it have one, as some have supposed)
may be detected in the day time, when this planet
is in a favourable position for such an observation;
particularly when a pretty large portion of its
enlightened surface is turned towards the earth,
and when its satellite, of course, must present a
similar phase. About the period of its greatest
elongation from the sun, and soon after it assumes
a crescent phase, in its approach to the inferior
conjunction, may be considered as the most eligible
times for prosecuting such observations. If
this supposed satellite be about one third or one
fourth of the diameter of its Primary, as Cassini,
Short, Baudouin, Montbarron, Montaigne, and
other astronomers supposed, it must be nearly as
large as Mercury, which has been frequently seen
in day-light. If such a satellite have a real existence,
and yet undistinguishable in day-light, its
surface must be of a very different quality for
reflecting the rays of light from that of its primary;
for it is obvious to every one who has seen
Venus with a high power, in the day-time, that a
body of equal brilliancy&mdash;though four times less
in diameter&mdash;would be quite perceptible, and
exhibit a visible disk. Such observations, however,
would be made, with a much greater effect
in Italy and other Southern countries, and particularly
in Tropical climates, such as the southern
parts of Asia and America, and in the West India
Islands, where the sky is more clear and serene,
and where the planet may be viewed at higher
altitudes, and for a greater length of time, without
the interruption of clouds, than in our island.</p>

<p>Again, the apparent magnitudes of the fixed
stars&mdash;the quantity of light they respectively
emit&mdash;and the precise class of magnitude which
should be assigned to them&mdash;might be more accurately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
determined by day observations, than by
their appearance in the nocturnal sky. All the
stars which are reckoned to belong to the <i>first
magnitude</i> are not equally distinguishable in day-light.
For example, the stars <i>Aldebaran</i> and
<i>Procyon</i> are not so easily distinguished, nor do
they appear with the same degree of lustre by
day, as the stars α <i>Lyr&aelig;</i> and <i>Capella</i>. In like
manner the stars <i>Altair</i>, <i>Alphard</i>, <i>Deneb Ras
Alkague</i>, considered as belonging to the <i>second</i>
magnitude, are not equally distinguishable by the
same aperture and magnifying power&mdash;which
seems to indicate, that a different quantity of light
is emitted by these stars, arising from a difference
either in their magnitude, their distance, or the
quality of the light with which they are irradiated.</p>

<p>The following are likewise practical purposes to
which celestial day observations may be applied.
In accurately adjusting Circular and Transit instruments,
it is useful, and even necessary, for
determining the exact position of the meridian, to
take observations of certain stars, which differ
greatly in zenith distance, and which transit the
meridian nearly at the same time. But as the
stars best situated for this purpose, cannot, at
every season, be seen in the evenings, we must, in
certain cases, wait for several months till such observations
can be made, unless we make them in
the day-time, which can very easily be done, if
the instrument have a telescope adapted to it, furnished
with such powers as those above stated, or
higher powers if required. I have likewise made
use of observations on the stars in the day time
for adjusting a clock or watch to meantime, when
the sun was in a situation beyond the range of the
instrument, or obscured by clouds, and when I did
not choose to wait till the evening. This may, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
first view, appear to some as paradoxical; since
the finding of a star in day-light depends on our
knowing its right Ascension from the sun, and
this last circumstance depends, in some measure,
on our knowing the true time. But if a watch or
clock is known not to have varied above seven or
eight minutes from the time, a star of the first
magnitude may easily be found, by moving the
telescope a little backwards or forwards, till the
star appear; and when it is once found, the exact
variation of the movement is then ascertained, by
comparing the calculations which were previously
necessary, with the time pointed out by the nonius
on the Equatorial circle&mdash;or, in other words, by
ascertaining the difference between the time assumed,
and the time indicated by the instrument,
when the star appears in the centre of the field of
view. All this may be accomplished in five or six
minutes.</p>

<p>Besides the practical purposes now stated, the
Equatorial telescope is perhaps the best instrument
for instructing a learner in the various operations
of practical astronomy, and particularly for
enabling him to distinguish the names and positions
of the principal stars. For, when the right
Ascension and Declination of any star is known,
from astronomical tables, the telescope may be
immediately adjusted to point to it, which will
infallibly prevent his mistaking one star for another.
In this way, likewise, the precise position of the
planet <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Uranus</i>, <i>Vesta</i>, <i>Juno</i>, <i>Ceres</i>,
<i>Pallas</i>&mdash;a small comet, a nebula, a double star,
or any other celestial body not easily distinguishable
by the naked eye, may be readily pointed
out, when its right Ascension and Declination
are known to a near approximation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I cannot but express my surprise,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
that the Equatorial telescope is so little
known, even by many of the lovers of astronomical
science. In several respectable academies
in this part of Britain, and, if I am not misinformed,
in most of our universities, this instrument
is entirely unknown. This is the more unaccountable,
as a small equatorial may be purchased
for a moderate sum; and as there is no
single instrument so well adapted for illustrating
all the operations of Practical Astronomy. Where
very great accuracy is not required, it may occasionally
be made to serve the general purposes of
a <i>transit instrument</i> for observing the passages of
the sun and stars across the meridian. It may
likewise be made to serve as a <i>theodolite</i> for surveying
land and taking horizontal angles&mdash;as a
<i>Quadrant</i> for taking angles of altitude&mdash;as a <i>level</i>&mdash;as
an <i>equal altitude instrument</i>&mdash;an <i>azimuth
instrument</i> for ascertaining the sun’s distance from
the north or south points of the horizon&mdash;and as
an accurate Universal Sun Dial, for finding the
exact <i>mean</i> or <i>true</i> time, on any occasion when
the sun is visible. The manner of applying it to
these different purposes will be obvious to every
one who is in the least acquainted with the nature
and construction of this instrument.</p>

<p>The price of a small Equatorial instrument,
such as that described p. 454, is about 16 guineas,
exclusive of some of the eye-pieces, which were
afterwards added for the purpose of making particular
observations. Instruments of a larger size,
and with more complicated machinery, sell from
50 to 100 guineas and upwards. Messrs. W. and
S. Jones, Holborn, London, construct such instruments.

<h4 id="ON_THE_ASTRONOMICAL_QUADRANT">ON THE QUADRANT.</h4>

</div>

<p>Every circle being supposed to be divided into
360 equal parts, or degrees,&mdash;it is evident, that
90 degrees, or the fourth part of a circle, will be
sufficient to measure all angles, between the horizon
of any place and the line perpendicular to it
which goes up to the zenith. Thus, in fig. 87,
the line CB represents the plane of the horizon.
ACBH, the quadrant, AC the perpendicular to
the horizon, and A the zenith point. If the lines
BC and CA represent a pair of compasses with
the legs standing perpendicular to each other, and
the curved lines AB, DE and FG, the quarter
of as many circles of different sizes&mdash;it is evident
that although each of these differs from the others
in size, yet that each contains the same portion
of a circle, namely a quadrant or fourth part;
and thus it would be from the smallest to the
largest quadrant that could be formed,&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
would all contain exactly 90 degrees each. By
the application of this principle the comparative
measure of angles may be extended to an indefinite
distance. By means of an instrument constructed
in the form of a quadrant of a circle,
with its curved edge divided into 90 equal parts,
the altitude of any object in the heavens can at
any time be determined.</p>

<p>There are various constructions of this instrument,
some of them extremely simple, and others
considerably complex and expensive, according to
the degree of accuracy which the observations require.
The following is a description of the
<i>Pillar Quadrant</i>, as it was made by Mr. Bird, for
the observatory of Greenwich, and several continental
observatories.</p>

<p>This instrument consists of a quadrant E E H G L
(fig. 88.) mounted on a pillar B, which is supported
by a tripod AA, resting on three foot
screws. The quadrant, the pillar, and the horizontal
circle all revolve round a vertical axis. A
telescope H is placed on the horizontal radius,
and is directed to a meridian mark previously
made on some distant object for placing the plane
of the instrument in the meridian, and also for
setting the zero, or beginning of the scale truly
horizontal. This is sometimes done by a level
instead of a telescope, and sometimes by a plumb-line
G, suspended from near the centre, and
brought to bisect a fine dot made on the limb,
where a microscope is placed to examine the bisection.
The weight or plummet at the end of the
plumb-line is suspended in the cistern of water
<i>b</i>, which keeps it from being agitated by the air.
A similar dot is made for the upper end of the
plumb-line upon a piece of brass, adjustable by
a screw <i>d</i>, in order that the line may be exactly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
at right angles to the telescope, when it is placed
at <span class="smcap">o</span>. The quadrant is screwed by the centre of
its frame, against a piece of brass <i>e</i> with three
screws, and this piece is screwed to the top of the
pillar B with other three screws. By means of
the first three screws, the plane of the quadrant
can be placed exactly parallel to the vertical axis,
and by the other screws the telescope H can be
placed exactly perpendicular to it. The nut of
the delicate screw L is attached to the end of the
telescope F, by a universal joint. The collar for
the other end is jointed in the same manner to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
clamp which can be fastened to any part of the
limb. A similar clamp-screw and slow motion is
seen at <i>n</i> for the lower circle, which is intended to
hold the circle fast, and adjust its motion. The
divisions of the lower, or horizontal circle, are
read by verniers, or noniuses, fixed to the arms
of the tripod at <i>l</i> and <i>m</i>, and, in some cases three
are used to obtain greater accuracy.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 88.</i></p>
<img id="fig088" src="images/fig088.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In using this quadrant, the axis of the telescope
H is adjusted to a horizontal line, and the
plane of the quadrant to a vertical line, by the
means already stated. The screw of the champ
L is then loosened, and the telescope directed to
the star, or other object, whose altitude is required.
The clamp screw being fixed, the observer
looks through the telescope, and with the nut of
the screw L he brings the telescope into a position
where the star is bisected by the intersection of
the wires in the field of the telescope. The divisions
are then to be read off upon the vernier,
and the altitude of the star will be obtained. By
means of the horizontal circle D, all angles in the
plane of the horizon may be accurately measured&mdash;such
as the amplitudes and azimuths of the celestial
bodies.</p>

<p>Quadrants of a more simple construction than
the above, may be occasionally used, such as
Gunter’s, Cole’s, Sutton’s and others; but none
of these are furnished with telescopes, or telescopic
sights, and therefore an altitude cannot be obtained
by them with the same degree of accuracy
as with that which has been now described.</p>

<p>By means of the Quadrant, not only the altitudes
of the heavenly bodies may be determined,
but also the distances of objects on the earth by
observations made at two stations&mdash;the altitude
of fireballs and other meteors in the atmosphere&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
height of a cloud, by observation on its
altitude and velocity&mdash;and numerous other problems,
the solution of which depends upon angular
measurements. A <i>Mural Quadrant</i> is the name
given to this instrument when it is fixed upon a
wall of stone, and in the plane of the meridian,
such as the quadrant which was erected by Flamstead
in the Observatory at Greenwich. Although
the quadrant was formerly much used in astronomical
observations, yet it may be proper to state,
that its use has now been almost completely superseded
by the recent introduction of <i>Astronomical
Circles</i>, of which we shall now give the reader a
very short description, chiefly taken from Troughton’s
account of the instrument he constructed,
as found in Sir D. Brewster’s Supplement to
Ferguson’s Astronomy.</p>

<h4 id="THE_ASTRONOMICAL_CIRCLE">THE ASTRONOMICAL CIRCLE.</h4>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 89.</i></p>
<img id="fig089" src="images/fig089.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>An astronomical circle is a <i>complete circle</i> substituted
in place of the quadrant, and differs from
it only in the superior accuracy with which it
enables the astronomer to make his observations.
The large vertical or declination circle CC (fig.
89.) is composed of two complete circles strengthened
by an edge bar on their inside, and firmly
united at their extreme borders by a number of
short braces or bars which stand perpendicular
between them, and which keep them at such a
distance as to admit the achromatic telescope TT.
This double circle is supported by 16 conical bars,
firmly united along with the telescope, to a horizontal
axis. The exterior limb of each circle is
divided into degrees and parts of a degree, and
these divisions are divided into seconds by means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
of the micrometer microscopes <i>mm</i>, which read off
the angle on opposite sides of each circle. The
cross wires in each microscope may be moved over
the limb till they coincide with the nearest division
of the limb, by means of the micrometer
screws <i>cc</i>, and the space moved through is ascertained
by the divisions on the graduated head above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
<i>c</i>, assisted by a scale within the microscope. The
microscopes are supported by two arms proceeding
from a small circle concentric with the horizontal
axis, and fixed to the vertical columns.
This circle is the centre upon which they can turn
round nearly a quadrant for the purpose of employing
a new portion of the divisions of the circle,
when it is reckoned prudent to repeat any delicate
observations upon any part of the limb. At <i>h</i>
is represented a level for placing the axis in a true
horizontal line, and at <i>k</i> is fixed another level
parallel to the telescope, for bringing the zero
of the divisions to a horizontal position. The
horizontal axis to which the vertical circle and
the telescope are fixed, is equal in length to the
distance between the vertical pillars, and its pivots
are supported by semicircular bearings, placed at
the top of each pillar. These two vertical pillars
are firmly united at their bases to a cross bar <i>f</i>.
To this cross bar is also fixed a vertical axis about
three feet long, the lower end of which terminating
in an obtuse point, rests in a brass conical
socket firmly fastened at the bottom of the hollow
in the stone pedestal D, which receives the vertical
axis. This socket supports the whole weight
of the moveable part of the instrument. The
upper part of the vertical axis is supported by
two pieces of brass, one of which is seen at <i>e</i>,
screwed to the ring <i>i</i>, and containing a right
angle, or Y. At each side of the ring, opposite
to the points of contact, is placed a tube containing
a heliacal spring, which, by a constant pressure
on the axis, keeps it against its bearings, and
permits it to turn, in these four points of contact,
with an easy and steady motion. The two bearings
are fixed upon two rings capable of a lateral
adjustment; the lower one by the screw <i>d</i> to incline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
the axis to the east or west, while the screw
<i>b</i> gives the upper one <i>i</i> a motion in the plane of
the meridian. By this means the axis may be
adjusted to a perpendicular position as exactly as
by the usual method of the tripod with feet
screws. These rings are attached to the centre
piece <i>s</i>, which is firmly connected with the upper
surface of the stone by six conical Tubes A, A, A,
&amp;c., and brass standards at every angle of the
pedestal. Below this frame lies the azimuth
circle EE consisting of a circular limb, strengthened
by ten hollow cones firmly united with the
vertical axis, and consequently turning freely
along with it. The azimuth circle EE is divided
and read off in the same manner as the vertical
circle. The arms of the microscopes BB project
from the ring <i>i</i>, and the microscopes themselves
are adjustable by screws, to bring them to zero
and to the diameter of the circle. A little above
the ring <i>i</i> is fixed an arm L which embraces and
holds fast the vertical axis with the aid of a champ
screw. The arm L is connected at the extremity
with one of the arms A, by means of the
screw <i>a</i>, so that by turning this screw, a slow
motion is communicated to the vertical axis and
the azimuth circle.</p>

<p>In order to place the instrument in a true vertical
position, a plumb-line, made of fine silver
wire, is suspended from a small hook at the top of
the vertical tube <i>n</i>, connected by braces with one
of the large pillars. The plumb-line passes
through an angle in which it rests, and by means
of a screw may be brought into the axis of the
tube. The plummet at the lower end of the line
is immersed in a cistern of water <i>t</i>, in order to
check its oscillations, and is supported on a shelf
proceeding from one of the pillars. At the lower
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
end of the tube <i>n</i> are fixed two microscopes <i>o</i> and
<i>p</i>, at right angles to one another, and opposite to
each is placed a small tube containing a lucid
point. The plumb-line is then brought into such
a position by the screws <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>, and by altering
the suspension of the plumb-line itself, that the
image of the luminous point, like the disk of a
planet, is formed on the plumb-line, and accurately
bisected by it. The vertical axis is then turned
round, and the plumb-line examined in some other
position. If it still bisects the luminous point,
the instrument is truly vertical; but if it does
not, one half of the deviation must be corrected
by the screws <i>d</i> <i>b</i>, and the other half by altering
the suspension of the line till the bisection of the
circular image is perfect in every position of the
instrument.</p>

<p>It is not many years since Circular Repeating
instruments came into general use. The principle
on which the construction of a repeating circle is
founded appears to have been first suggested by
Professor Mayer of Gottingen, in 1758; but the
first person who applied this principle to measure
round the limb of a divided instrument, was
Borda, who about the year 1789, caused a repeating
circle to be constructed that would measure
with equal facility horizontal and vertical angles.
Afterwards, Mr. Troughton greatly improved the
construction of Borda’s instrument by the introduction
of several contrivances which ensure, at
the same time, its superior accuracy and convenience
in use; and his instruments have been introduced
into numerous observatories. Circular instruments,
on a large scale, have been placed in
the Royal Observatory of Greenwich, and in most
of the principal observatories on the continent of
Europe. Although it is agreed on all hands that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
greater accuracy may be obtained by a repeating
circle, than by any other having the same radius,
yet there are some objections to its use which do
not apply to the altitude and azimuth circle. The
following are the principal objections, as stated in
Vol. I., of the ‘Memoirs of the Astronomical
Society of London.’ 1. The origin of the repeating
circle is due to <i>bad dividing</i>, which ought not
to be tolerated in any instrument in the present
state of the art. 2. There are three sources of
fixed error which cannot be exterminated, as they
depend more on the materials than on the workmanship;
first, the zero of the level changes with
variations of temperature; secondly, the resistance
of the centre work to the action of the
tangent screws; and thirdly, the imperfection of
the screws in producing motion, and in securing
permanent positions. 3. The instrument is applied
with most advantage to slowly moving or
circumpolar stars; but in low altitudes these stars
are seen near the horizon, where refraction interferes.
4. Much time and labour are expended, first
in making the observations, and again in reducing
them. 5. When any one step in a series of observations
is bad, the whole time and labour are
absolutely lost. 6. When the instrument has a
telescope of small power, the observations are
charged with errors of vision, which the repeating
circle will not cure. 7. This instrument cannot
be used as a transit instrument, nor for finding
the exact meridian of a place.</p>

<p>A great variety of directions is necessary in
order to enable the student of practical astronomy
thoroughly to understand and to apply this instrument
to practice, which the limited nature of the
present work prevents us from detailing.&mdash;As this
instrument consists of a variety of complicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
pieces of machinery, it is necessarily somewhat
expensive. A six inch brass astronomical circle
for altitudes, zenith or polar distances, azimuths,
with achromatic telescope, &amp;c., is marked in
Messrs. W. and S. Jones’ catalogue of astronomical
instruments, at &pound;27 6s. A circle 12 inches
diameter, from &pound;36 15s. to &pound;68 5s. An 18 inch
ditto, of the best construction, &pound;105. The
larger astronomical circles for public observatories,
from 100 to a 1000 guineas and upwards, according
to their size, and the peculiarity of their construction.</p>

<h4 id="THE_TRANSIT_INSTRUMENT">THE TRANSIT INSTRUMENT.</h4>

<p>A Transit instrument is intended for observing
celestial objects as they pass across the meridian.
It consists of a telescope fixed at right angles to a
horizontal axis&mdash;which axis must be so supported
that what is called <i>the line of collimation</i>, or the
line of sight of the telescope, may move in the
plane of the meridian. This instrument was first
invented by Romer in the year 1689, but has since
received great improvements by Troughton, Jones
and other modern artists. Transit instruments
may be divided into two classes, <i>Portable</i>, and
<i>Fixed</i>. The portable instrument, when placed
truly in the meridian, and well adjusted, may be
advantageously used as a stationary instrument in
an observatory, if its dimensions be such as to
admit of a telescope of 3&frac12; feet focal length; but
when the main tube is only from 20 to 30 inches
long, with a proportional aperture, it is more
suited for a travelling instrument to give the exact
time; and, when carried on board a ship in a
voyage of discovery, may be taken on shore at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
any convenient place, for determining the solar
time of that place, and for correcting the daily
rate of the Chronometer giving the time at the
first meridian, so that the longitude of the place
of observation may be obtained from the difference
of the observed and indicated times, after the
proper corrections have been made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 90.</i></p>
<img id="fig090" src="images/fig090.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The following is a brief description of one of
Mr. Troughton’s Portable Transit Instruments.
In fig. 90. PP is an achromatic telescope firmly
fixed, by the middle to a double conical and horizontal
axis HH, the pivots of which rest on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
angular bearings called Ys, at the top of the
standards B, B, rendered steady by oblique braces
DD, fastened to the central part of the circle, AA.
In large fixed instruments, the pivots and angular
bearings are supported on two massive stone pillars,
sunk several feet into the ground, and are
sometimes supported by mason-work, to secure
perfect stability. The axis HH has two adjustments,
one for making it exactly level, and the
other for placing the telescope in the meridian. A
graduated circle L is fixed to the extremity of the
pivot which extends beyond one of the Ys, and
the two radii that carry the verniers <i>aa</i>, are fitted
to the extremities of the pivot in such a way as to
turn round independent of the axis. The double
verniers have a small level attached to them, and
a third arm <i>b</i>, which is connected with the standard
B by means of a screw <i>s</i>. If the verniers are
placed by means of the level, in a true horizontal
position, when the axis of the telescope is horizontal,
and the arm <i>b</i> screwed by the screw <i>s</i> to
the standard B, the verniers will always read off
the inclination of the telescope, and will enable
the observer to point it to any star, by means of
its meridian altitude. The whole instrument
rests on three foot screws entered into the circle
AA. In the field of view of the telescope, there
are several parallel vertical wires, crossed at right
angles with a horizontal one, and the telescope is
sometimes furnished with a diagonal eye-piece,
for observing stars near the zenith. A level likewise
generally accompanies the instrument, in
order to place it horizontal, by being applied to
the pivots of the axis.</p>

<p>In order to fix the transit instrument exactly in
the meridian, a good clock regulated to sidereal
time is necessary. This regulation may be effected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
by taking equal altitudes of the sun or a star
before and after they pass the meridian, which
may be done by small quadrants, or by a good
sextant. The axis H of the instrument is then
to be placed horizontal by a spirit level, which
accompanies the transit, and the greatest care
must be taken that the axis of vision describes in
the heavens a great circle of the sphere. To ascertain
whether the telescope be in the plane of
the meridian, observe by the clock when a circumpolar
star seen through the telescope transits both
above and below the pole; and if the times of
describing the eastern and western parts of its
circuit be equal, the telescope is then in the plane
of the meridian; otherwise, certain adjustments
must be made. When the telescope is at length
perfectly adjusted, a land-mark must be fixed
upon, at a considerable distance&mdash;the greater the
better. This mark must be in the horizontal
direction of the intersection of the cross wires,
and in a place where it can be illuminated,
if possible, in the night time, by a lantern hanging
near it; which mark being on a fixed object, will
serve at all times afterwards for examining the
position of the telescope.</p>

<p>Various observations and adjustments are requisite
in order to fixing a transit instrument exactly
in the plane of the meridian. There is the adjustment
of the <i>level</i>&mdash;the horizontal adjustment
of the axis of the telescope&mdash;the placing of the
parallel lines in the focus of the eye-glass, so as to
be truly vertical, and to determine the equatorial
value of their intervals&mdash;the collimation in <i>azimuth</i>,
so that a line passing from the middle vertical line
to the optical centre of the object-glass, is at right
angles with the axis of the telescope’s motion&mdash;the
collimation in <i>altitude</i>, so that the horizontal line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
should cross the parallel vertical lines, not only at
right angles, but also in the optical centre of the
field of view&mdash;with various other particulars; but
of which our limited space will not permit us to
enter into details. Those who wish to enter into
all the minute details in reference to the construction
and practical application of this and the other
instruments above described, as well as all the
other instruments used by the Practical Astronomer,
will find ample satisfaction in perusing the
Rev. Dr. Pearson’s Introduction to Practical
Astronomy, 4to., Vol. II.</p>

<p>A portable Transit instrument, with a cast-iron
stand, the axis 12 inches in length, and the achromatic
telescope about 20 inches, packed in a case,
sells at about 16 guineas: with a brass-framed
stand and other additions, at about 20 guineas.
Transit instruments of larger dimensions are higher
in proportion to their size, &amp;c.

<h4 id="ON_OBSERVATORIES">ON OBSERVATORIES.</h4>

<p>In order to make observations, with convenience
and effect, on the heavenly bodies, it is expedient
that an <i>observatory</i>, or place for making
the requisite observations, be erected in a proper
situation. The following are some of the leading
features of a spot adapted for making celestial
observations: 1. It should command an extensive
visible horizon all around, particularly towards
the south and the north. 2. It should be a little
elevated above surrounding objects. 3. It should
be, if possible, at a considerable distance from
manufactories, and other objects which emit much
smoke or vapour, and even from chimney-tops
where no sensible smoke is emitted, as the heated
air from the top of funnels causes undulations in
the atmosphere. 4. It should be at a distance
from swampy ground or valleys that are liable to
be covered with fogs and exhalations. 5. It
should not, if possible, be too near public roads,
particularly if paved with stones, and frequented
by heavy carriages, as in such situations, undulations
and tremulous motions may be produced,
injurious to the making of accurate observations
with graduated instruments. 6. It is expedient
that the astronomical observer should have access
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
to some distant field within a mile of the observatory,
on which a meridian mark may be fixed,
after his graduated instruments are properly adjusted.
The distance at which a meridian mark
should be erected will depend in part on the focal
length of the telescope generally used for making
observations on the Right Ascensions and declinations
of the stars. It should be fixed at such a
distance that the mark may be distinctly seen
without altering the focus of the telescope when
adjusted to the sun or stars, which, in most cases,
will require to be at least half a mile from the
place of observation, and more if it can be
obtained.</p>

<p>Observatories may be distinguished into public
and private. A <i>private</i> observatory may be comprehended
in a comparatively small building, or
in the wing of a building of ordinary dimensions
for a family, provided the situation is adapted to
it. Most of our densely-peopled towns and cities,
which abound in narrow streets and lanes, are
generally unfit for good observatories, unless at
an elevated position at their extremities. Public
observatories, where a great variety of instruments
is used, and where different observers are employed,
require buildings of larger dimensions,
divided into a considerable number of apartments.
The observatory of <i>Greenwich</i> is composed principally
of two separate buildings&mdash;one of which is
the observatory properly so called, where the
assistant lives and makes all his observations; the
other is the dwelling-house in which the astronomer-royal
resides. The former consists of three
rooms on the ground-floor, the middle of which
is the assistant’s sitting and calculating room,
furnished with a small library of such books only
as are necessary for his computations, and an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
accurate clock made by the celebrated Graham,
which once served Dr. Halley as a transit-clock.
Immediately over this is the assistant’s bed-room,
with an alarum to awake him to make his observations
at the proper time. The room on the
eastern side of this is called the <i>transit</i>-room, in
which is an 8 feet transit instrument, with an axis
of 3 feet, resting on 2 pieces of stone, made by
Mr. Bird, but successively improved by Messrs.
Dollond, Troughton and others. Here is also a
chair to observe with, the back of which lets
down to any degree of elevation that convenience
may require. On the western side is the <i>quadrant
room</i>, with a stone pier in the middle running
north and south, having on its eastern face a
mural quadrant of 8 feet radius, by which observations
are made on the southern quarter of the
meridian, through an opening in the roof, of 3
feet wide, produced by means of two sliding
shutters. On the western face is another mural
quadrant of 8 feet radius, the frame of which is
of iron, and the arch of brass, which is occasionally
applied to the north quarter of the meridian.
In the same room is the famous zenith sector, 12
feet long, with which Dr. Bradley made the observations
which led to the discovery of the nutation
of the earth’s axis and the aberration of the
light of the fixed stars. Here are also Dr.
Hooke’s reflecting quadrant and three time-keepers
by Harrison. On the south side of this
room a small wooden building is erected for the
purpose of observing the eclipses of Jupiter’s
satellites, occultations of stars by the moon, and
other phenomena which require merely the use of
a telescope, and the true or mean time. It is
furnished with sliding shutters on the roof and
sides to view any part of the hemisphere from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
Prime Vertical down to the southern horizon. It
contains a 40-inch achromatic, with a triple object-glass;
and also a 5 feet achromatic by Messrs.
John and Peter Dollond&mdash;a 2 feet reflecting telescope
by Edwards, and a 6 feet reflector by Herschel.
Above the dwelling-house is a large octagonal
room, which is made the repository for
certain old instruments, and for those which are
too large to be used in the other apartments.
Among many other instruments, it contains an
excellent 10 feet achromatic by Dollond, and a 6
feet reflector by Short. Upon a platform, in an
open space, is erected the great reflecting telescope
constructed by Mr. Ramage of Aberdeen,
on the Herschelian principle, which has a speculum
of 15 inches diameter, and 25 feet focal length,
remarkable for the great accuracy and brilliancy
with which it exhibits celestial objects. Various
other instruments of a large size, and of modern
construction, have of late years been introduced
into this observatory, such as the large and splendid
transit instrument constructed by Troughton,
in 1816&mdash;the two large <i>mural circles</i> by Troughton
and Jones&mdash;the transit clock, by Mr. Hardy, and
several other instruments and apparatus which it
would be too tedious to enumerate and describe.</p>

<p>Every observatory, whether public or private,
should be furnished with the following instruments.
1. A transit instrument for observing the
meridian passage of the sun, planets and stars.
2. A good clock whose accuracy may be depended
upon. 3. An achromatic telescope, at least 44
inches focal distance, with powers of from 45 to
180 for viewing planetary and other phenomena&mdash;or,
a good reflecting telescope at least 3 feet long,
and the speculum 5 inches diameter. 4. An
equatorial instrument, for viewing the stars and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
planets in the day-time, and for finding the
Right Ascension and declination of a comet, or
any other celestial phenomenon. Where this
instrument is possessed, and in cases where no
great degree of accuracy is required, the equatorial
may be made to serve the general purposes
of a transit instrument.</p>

<p>A private observatory might be constructed in
any house which has a commanding view of the
heavens, provided there is an apartment in it, in
which windows may be placed, or openings cut
out fronting the north, the south, the east and
the west. The author of this work has a small
observatory erected on the top of his house, which
commands a view of 20 miles towards the east, 30
miles towards the west, and north-west, and
about 20 miles towards the south, at an elevation
of above 200 feet above the level of the sea, and
the banks of the Tay, which are about half a mile
distant. The apartment is 12&frac12; feet long by
8&frac12; wide, and 8&frac12; feet between the floor and the
roof. It has an opening on the north by which
observations can be made on the pole-star; a window
on the south by which the meridian-passages
of the heavenly bodies may be observed; another
opening towards the east, and a fourth opening,
consisting of a door, towards the west. There is
a pavement of lead on the outside, all around the
observatory-room, enclosed by a stone parapet 3&frac12;
feet high, the upper part of which is coped with
broad flat stones, in certain parts of which groves
or indentations are made for receiving the feet of
the pedestal of an achromatic telescope, which
form a steady support for the telescope in the
open air, when the weather is calm and serene,
and when observations are intended to be made
on any region of the heavens. By placing an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
instrument on this parapet, it may be directed to
any point of the celestial canopy, except a small
portion near the northern horizon, which is
partly intercepted by a small hill. In the following
ground-plan, fig. 91. AAA, is the parapet
surrounding the observatory-room; BBB, a walk
around it nearly 3 feet broad, covered with lead.
O is the apartment for the observatory, having an
opening C to the north, another opening D to the
east, E is a window which fronts the south, and
F is a door fronting the west, by which an access
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
is obtained to the open area on the outside. GHI
is an area on the outside towards the south,
covered with lead, 15 feet long from G to H, and
6&frac12; feet from E to I, from which a commanding
view of the southern, eastern and western portions
of the heavens may be obtained: <i>eeee</i> are
positions on the top of the parapet where a telescope
may be conveniently placed, when observations
are intended to be made in the open air.
The top of this parapet is elevated about 30 feet
from the level of the ground. On the roof of the
observatory, about 12 feet above its floor, on the
outside is a platform of lead, surrounded by a
railing, 6 feet by 5, with a seat, on which observations
either on celestial or terrestrial objects
may occasionally be made. K is a door or hatchway,
which forms an entrance into the observatory
from the apartments below, which folds down,
and forms a portion of the floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 91.</i></p>
<img id="fig091" src="images/fig091.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the perspective view of the building fronting
the title-page, the position and general aspect of
the observatory-part of the building may be more
distinctly perceived.</p>

<p>In public observatories, where zenith or polar
distances require to be measured, it is necessary
that there should be a dome, with an opening
across the roof and down the north and south
walls. Should an altitude or azimuth circle, or
an equatorial instrument be used, they will require
a revolving roof with openings and doors on
two opposite sides, to enable an observer to follow
a heavenly body across all the cardinal points.
The openings may be about 15 inches wide, and
the roof needs not be larger than what is requisite
for giving room to the observer and the instrument,
lest its bulk and weight should impede its
easy motion. There have been various plans
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
adopted for revolving domes. Fig. 92 represents
a section of the rotatory dome constructed at East
Sheen by the Rev. Dr. Pearson. This dome
turns round on three detached spheres of lignum
vit&aelig;, in a circular bed, formed partly by the
dome, and partly by the cylindrical frame-work,
which surrounds the circular room of 9 feet
diameter. A section of this bed forms a square
which the sphere just fills, so as to have a small
play to allow for shrinking; and, when the dome
is carried round, the spheres, having exactly
equal diameters of 4&frac14; inches each, when placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
at equal distances from one another, keep their
relative places, and move together in a beautifully
smooth manner. These spheres act as friction
rollers in two directions at the four points of contact,
in case any obstacle is opposed to their progressive
motion by the admission of dirt, or by
any change of figure of the wood that composes
the rings of the dome, and of the gang-way. No
groove is here made, but what the weight of the
roof resting on the hard sphere occasions. The
dome itself moves twice round for the balls once,
and has, in this way, its friction diminished. The
wood of this dome is covered by Wyatt’s patent
copper, one square foot of which weighs upwards
of a pound; and the copper is so turned over the
nails that fix it at the parts of junction, that
not a single nail is seen in the whole dome. This
covering is intended to render the dome more
permanent than if it had been made of wood alone.
At the observatory at Cambridge the dome is made
chiefly of iron. In the figure <i>a</i>, <i>a</i> represents one
of the two oblong doors that meet at the apex of
the cone, and a piece of sheet-copper bent over the
upper end of the door which shuts last, keeps the
rain from entering at the place of junction. The
two halves of the dome are united by brass rods
passing through the door-cheeks of wainscot at <i>a</i>
and <i>a</i> by means of nuts that screw upon their
ends, which union allows the dome to be separated
into two parts when there may be occasion to displace
it. The wooden plate <i>bb</i>, which appears in
a straight line, is a circular broad ring to which
the covering wainscot boards are made fast above
the eaves, and <i>cc</i> is a similar ring forming the
wall-plate or gang-way on which the dome rests
and revolves.

</div>

<p>Fig. 92* shows a small door that lies over the
summit of the dome, and may be separately
opened for zenith observations; the rod of metal
with a ring at the lower end passing through it,
serves to open and shut this door, and at the same
time carries upon its upper end a large ball that
falls back on the roof when the door is open, and
keeps the door in a situation to be acted upon by
the hook of a handle that is used for this purpose.
The doors <i>aa</i> being curved, are made to open in
two halves, the upper one being opened first, on
account of its covering the end of the other; and
the observer may open one or two doors as may
best suit his purpose. The weight of this dome
is such that a couple of wedges, inserted by a
gentle blow between the rings <i>bb</i> and <i>cc</i>, will
keep it in its situation under the influence of the
strongest wind.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to remark, that in all
observatories, and in every apartment where celestial
observations are made, there should, if possible,
be a uniform temperature; and consequently
a fire should never be kept in such places, particularly
when observations are intended to be
made, as it would cause currents of air through
the doors and other openings, which would be
injurious to the accuracy of observations. When
a window is opened in an ordinary apartment
where a fire is kept, there is a current of heated
air which rushes out at the top, and a current of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
cold air which rushes in from below, producing
agitations and undulations, which prevent even a
good telescope from showing celestial objects distinct
and well defined; and, I have no doubt, that
many young observers have been disappointed in
their views of celestial phenomena, from this circumstance,
when viewing the heavenly bodies
from heated rooms in cold winter evenings; as
the a&euml;rial undulations before the telescope prevent
distinct vision of such objects as the belts of
Jupiter, the spots of Mars, and the rings of
Saturn.

<h4 id="ON_ORRERIES_OR_PLANETARIUMS">ON ORRERIES OR PLANETARIUMS.</h4>

<p>An orrery is a machine for representing the
order, the motions, the phases, and other phenomena
of the planets. Although orreries and planetariums
are not so much in use as they were half a
century ago, yet as they tend to assist the conceptions
of the astronomical tyro in regard to the
motions, order, and positions of the bodies which
compose the solar system, it may not be inexpedient
shortly to describe the principles and construction
of some of these machines.</p>

<p>The reason why the name <i>Orrery</i> was at first
given to such machines, is said to have been owing
to the following circumstance. Mr. Rowley, a
mathematical-instrument-maker, having got one
from Mr. George Graham, the original inventor,
to be sent abroad with some of his own instruments,
he copied it and made the first for the Earl
of Orrery. Sir R. Steele, who knew nothing of
Mr. Graham’s machine&mdash;thinking to do justice to
the first encourager, as well as to the inventor of
such a curious instrument, called it an <i>Orrery</i>,
and gave Mr. Rowley the praise due to Mr.
Graham. The construction of such machines is
not a modern invention. The hollow sphere of
Archimedes was a piece of mechanism of this kind,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
having been intended to exhibit the motions of
the sun, the moon, and the five planets, according
to the Ptolemaic system. The next orrery of
which we have any account was that of Posidonius,
who lived about 80 years before the Christian era,
of which Cicero says, ‘If any man should carry
the sphere of Posidonius into Scythia or Britain,
in every revolution of which the motions of the
sun, moon and five planets, were the same as in
the heavens, each day and night, who in those
barbarous countries could doubt of its being
finished&mdash;not to say actuated&mdash;by perfect reason?’
The next machine of this kind, which history
records, was constructed by the celebrated Boethius,
the Christian Philosopher, about the year of Christ
510&mdash;of which it was said ‘that it was a machine
pregnant with the universe&mdash;a portable heaven&mdash;a
compendium of all things.’ After this period,
we find no instances of such mechanism of any
note till the 16th century, when science began to
revive, and the arts to flourish. About this time
the curious clock in Hampton Court Palace was
constructed, which shows not only the hours of
the day, but the motions of the sun and moon
through all the signs of the zodiac, and other celestial
phenomena. Another piece of mechanism of
a similar kind is the clock in the cathedral of
Strasburg, in which besides the clock part, is a
celestial globe or sphere with the motions of the
sun, moon, planets and the firmament of the fixed
stars, which was finished in 1574.</p>

<p>Among the largest and most useful pieces of
machinery of this kind, is the great sphere erected
by Dr. Long in Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.
This machine, which he called the <i>Uranium</i>, consists
of a planetarium which exhibits the motion
of the earth and the primary planets, the sun, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
the motion of the moon round the earth, all enclosed
within a sphere. Upon the sphere, besides
the principal circles of the celestial globe, the
Zodiac is placed, of a breadth sufficient to contain
the apparent path of the moon, with all the stars
over which the moon can pass, also the ecliptic,
and the heliocentric orbits of all the planets. The
Earth in the planetarium has a moveable horizon,
to which a large moveable brass circle within the
sphere may be set coincident, representing the
plane of the horizon continued to the starry heavens.
The horizons being turned round sink
below the stars on the east side, and make them
appear to rise, and rise above the stars on the west
side, and make them appear to set. On the
other hand, the earth and the horizon being at
rest, the sphere may be turned round to represent
the apparent diurnal motion of the heavens. In
order to complete his idea on a large scale, the
Doctor erected a sphere of 18 feet diameter, in
which above 30 persons might sit conveniently,
the entrance to which is over the South Pole, by
six steps. The frame of the sphere consists of a
number of iron meridians, the northern ends of
which are screwed to a large round plate of brass
with a hole in the centre of it; through this hole,
from a beam in the ceiling, comes the north pole, a
round iron rod about three inches long, and which
supports the upper part of the sphere, to its
proper elevation for the latitude of Cambridge, so
much of it as is invisible in England being cut off,
and the lower or southern ends of the meridians
terminate on, and are screwed down to a strong
circle of oak 13 feet diameter, which, when the
sphere is put in motion, runs upon large rollers of
lignum vit&aelig;, in the manner that the tops of some
wind-mills turn round. Upon the iron meridians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
is fixed a zodiac of tin painted blue, on which the
ecliptic and heliocentric orbits of the planets are
drawn and the stars and constellations traced. The
whole is turned round with a small winch, with as
little labour as it takes to wind up a Jack, although
the weight of the iron, tin, and the wooden circle
is above a thousand pounds. This machine, though
now somewhat neglected, may still be seen in
Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where I had an opportunity
of inspecting it in November, 1839.
The essential parts of the machine still remain
nearly in the same state as when originally constructed
in 1758.</p>

<p>The machine which I shall now describe is of a
much smaller and less complex description than
that which has been noticed above, and may be
made for a comparatively small expense, while it
exhibits, with sufficient accuracy, the motions,
phases, and positions of all the primary planets,
with the exception of the new planets, which
cannot be accurately represented on account of
their orbits crossing each other. In order to the
construction of the Planetarium to which I allude,
we must compare the proportion which the annual
revolutions of the primary planets bear to that of
the Earth. This proportion is expressed in the
following table, in which the first column is the
time of the Earth’s period in days; the second,
that of the planets; and the third and fourth are
numbers very nearly in the same proportion to
each other.</p>

<p>On account of the number of teeth required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
for the wheel which moves Uranus, it is frequently
omitted in Planetariums, or the planet is placed
upon the arbor which supports Saturn. If we
now suppose a spindle or arbor with six wheels
<i>fixed</i> upon it in an horizontal position, having the
number of teeth in each corresponding to the
numbers in the third column, namely the wheel
AM (fig. 93.) of 83 teeth, BL of 52, CK of 50,
for the earth, DI of 40, EH of 7, and FG of 5;
and another set of wheels moving freely about an
arbor having the number of teeth in the fourth
column, namely AN of 20, BO of 32, CP of 50&mdash;for
the earth; DQ of 75, ER of 83, and FS of
148. Then, if these two arbors of fixed and
moveable wheels be made of the size, and fixed at
the distance here represented, the teeth of the
former will take hold of those of the latter, and
turn them freely when the machine is in motion.
These arbors, with their wheels, are to be placed
in a box of a proper size, in a perpendicular position;
the arbor of fixed wheels to move in pivots
at the top and bottom of the box, and the arbor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
of the moveable wheels to go through the top of
the box, and having on the top a wire fixed,
and bent at a proper distance into a right
angle upwards, bearing on the top a small
round ball, representing its proper planet. If
then, on the lower part of the arbor of fixed
wheels, be placed a pinion of screw-teeth, a winch
turning a spindle with an endless screw, playing
in the teeth of the arbor, will turn it with all its
wheels, and these wheels will turn the others
about with their planets, in their proper and respective
periods of time. For, while the fixed
wheel CK moves its equal CP once round, the
wheel AM will move AN a little more than four
times round, and will consequently exhibit the
motion of Mercury; the wheel EH will turn the
wheel ER about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub> round, representing the
proportional motion of Jupiter; and the wheel
FG will turn the wheel FS, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>29.5</sub> round,
and represent the motion of Saturn, and so of all
the rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The following figure (fig. 94.) represents the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
appearance of the instrument when completed.
Upon the upper part of the circular box is pasted
a Zodiac circle divided into 12 signs, and each
sign into 30 degrees, with the corresponding days
of the month. The wheel-work is understood to
be within the box, which may either be supported
by a tripod, or with four feet, as here represented.
The moon, and the satellites of Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus, are moveable only by the hand.
When the winch W is turned, then all the primary
planets are made to move in their respective velocities.
The ball in the centre represents the Sun,
which is either made of brass or of wood gilded
with gold.</p>

<p>By this Planetarium, simple as its construction
may appear, a variety of interesting exhibitions
may be made and problems performed, which may
be conducive to the instruction of young students
of astronomy. I shall mention only a few of
those as specimens.</p>

<p>1. When the planets are placed in their respective
positions by means of an Ephemeris or the
Nautical Almanack, the relative positions of those
bodies in respect to each other, the quarters of
the heavens where they may be observed, and
whether they are to be seen in the morning
before sun-rise or in the evening after sun-set, may
be at once determined. For example, on the 19th
of December, 1844, the <i>heliocentric</i> places of the
planets are as follows:&mdash;Uranus 2&deg; Aries; Saturn
8&deg; 27&acute; of Aquarius; Jupiter 7&deg; 4&acute; Aries; Mars 12&deg;
45&acute; Libra; the Earth 27&deg; 46&acute; Gemini; Venus
29&deg; 48&acute; Virgo; Mercury 7&deg; 53&acute; Pisces. When
the planets are placed on the planetarium in these
positions, and the eye placed in a line with the
balls representing the Earth and the Sun, all those
situated to the left of the sun are to the east of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
him, and are to be seen in the evening, and those
on the right, in the morning. In the present
case, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury are
evening stars, and Mars and Venus can only be
seen in the morning. Jupiter is in an aspect
nearly <i>quartile</i>, or 3 signs distant from the sun,
and Uranus is nearly in the same aspect.
Saturn is much nearer the sun, and Mercury is
not far from the period of its greatest <i>eastern</i>
elongation. Mars is not far from being in a quartile
aspect, <i>west</i> of the sun, and Venus is near the
same point of the heavens, approaching to the
period of its greatest <i>western</i> elongation, and consequently
will be seen before sun-rise as a beautiful
morning star. Jupiter and Uranus, to the
east of the sun, appear nearly directly opposite to
Venus and Mars, which are to the west of the sun.
The phase<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> of Venus is nearly that of a half-moon,
and Mercury is somewhat gibbous, approaching
to a half-moon phase. If, now, we turn
the machine by the winch till the Index of the
earth point at the 8th of August, 1845, we shall
find the planets in the following positions:&mdash;Mars
and Saturn are nearly in opposition to the sun;
Venus and Mercury are evening stars at no great
distance from each other, and Jupiter is a morning
star. In like manner if we turn the machine till
the Index point to any future months, or even
succeeding years, the various aspects and positions
of the planets may be plainly perceived. When
the planets are moved by the winch, in this machine,
we see them all <i>at once</i> in motion around the sun,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
with the same respective velocities and periods of
revolution which they have in the heavens. As the
planets are represented in the preceding positions,
Mercury, Jupiter and Mars, are evening stars,
and Venus, Saturn, and Uranus, morning stars,
if we suppose the earth placed in a line with
our eye and the sun.</p>

<p>2. By this instrument, the truth of the Copernican
or Solar system is clearly represented.
When the planets are in motion, we perceive the
planets Venus and Mercury to pass both before
and behind the sun, and to have two conjunctions.
We observe Mercury to be never more than a
certain angular distance from the sun, as viewed
from the earth, namely 27&deg;; and Venus 47&deg;. We
perceive that the superior planets, particularly
Mars, will be sometimes much nearer to the earth
than at others, and therefore must appear larger
at one time than at another, as they actually
appear in the heavens. We see that the planets
cannot appear from the earth to move with uniform
velocity; for when nearest they appear to move
faster, and slower when most remote. We likewise
observe that the planets appear from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
earth to move sometimes <i>direct</i>, or from west to
east, then become retrograde, or from east to west,
and between both to be <i>stationary</i>. All which
particulars exactly correspond with celestial observations.
For illustrating these particulars there
is a simple apparatus represented by fig. 95, which
consists of a hollow wire with a slit at top which
is placed over the arm of Mercury or Venus at E.
The arm DG represents a ray of light coming
from the planet at D to the earth at F. The
planets being then in motion, the planet D, as
seen in the heavens from the earth at F, will
undergo the several changes of position, which we
have described above, sometimes appearing to go
backwards and at other times forwards. The wire
prop, now supposed to be placed over Mercury at
E, may likewise be placed over any of the other
planets, particularly Mars, and similar phenomena
will be exhibited.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 95.</i></p>
<img id="fig095" src="images/fig095.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This machine may likewise be used to exhibit
the falsity of the Ptolemaic system, which places
the Earth in the centre, and supposes the sun and
all the planets to revolve around it. For this purpose,
the ball representing the Sun is removed,
and placed on the wire or pillar which supports the
Earth, and the ball representing the Earth is placed
in the centre. It will then be observed, that the
planets Mercury and Venus, being both within
the orbit of the sun, cannot at any time be seen
to go behind it, whereas, in the heavens we as
often see them go behind as before the sun.
Again, it shows that as the planets move in circular
orbits about the central earth, they ought at all
times to appear of the same magnitude; while, on
the contrary, we observe their apparent magnitudes
in the heavens to be very variable; Mars,
for example, appearing sometimes nearly as large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
as Jupiter, and at other times only like a small
fixed star. Again, it is here shown that the
planets may be seen at all distances from the sun;
for example, when the sun is setting, Mercury and
Venus, according to this arrangement, might be
seen, not only in the south but even in the eastern
quarter of the heavens&mdash;a phenomenon which was
never yet observed in any age; Mercury never
appearing beyond 27&deg; of the Sun, nor Venus
beyond 48&deg;. In short, according to the system
thus represented, it is seen, that the motions of
the planets should all be regular, and uniformly
the same in every part of their orbits, and that
they should all move the same way, namely from
west to east; whereas, in the heavens, they are
seen to move with variable velocities, sometimes
appearing stationary, and sometimes moving from
east to west, and from west to east. All which
circumstances plainly prove that the Ptolemaic
cannot be the true system of the universe.</p>

<p>A Planetarium, such as that now described, might be constructed
with brass wheel-work, for about 5 guineas. The brass wheel-work
of one which I long since constructed cost about 3 guineas, and the
other parts of the apparatus about 2 guineas more. The following
are the prices of some instruments of this kind as made by Messrs.
Jones, 30, Lower Holborn, London. ‘An Orrery, showing the
motions of the Earth, Moon, and inferior planets, Mercury and
Venus, by wheel-work, the board on which the instrument moves
being 13 inches diameter, &pound;4: 14s. 6d.’ ‘A Planetarium showing
the motions of all the primary planets by wheel-work with 1&frac12; inch or
3 inch papered globes,&mdash;according to the wheel-work and the neatness
of the stands, from &pound;7: 17s. 6d. to &pound;10: 10s.’ ‘Ditto, with wheel-work

<h4 id="DR_HENDERSONS_PLANETARIUM">HENDERSON’S PLANETARIUM.</h4>

<p>The following is a description of the most complete
and accurate planetarium I have yet seen.
The calculations occupied more than eight months.
For this article I am indebted to my learned and
ingenious friend Dr. Henderson, F.R.A.S., who
is known to many of my readers by his excellent
astronomical writings.</p>

<p>Section of the wheel-work of a Planetarium
for shewing with the utmost degree of accuracy
the mean tropical revolutions of the planets
round the sun, calculated by E. Henderson,
LL.D. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the above section the dark horizontal lines
represent the wheel-work of the Planetarium, and
the annexed numerals, the numbers of teeth in the
given wheel. The machine has three axes or
arbors, indicated by the letters A, B, C.&mdash;Axis
‘C,’ the ‘Yearly axis,’ is assumed to make one
revolution in 365.242,236 days, or, in 365 days
5<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup> and is furnished with wheels 17,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
44, 54, 36, 140, 96, 127, 86, which wheels are
all firmly riveted to said axis, and consequently
they turn round with it in the same time. Axle
‘B’ is a fixture; it consists of a steel rod, on
which a system of pairs of wheels revolve; thus
wheels 40 and 77 are made fast together by being
riveted on the same collet represented by the
thick dark space between them, as also of the
rest: the several wheels on this axis may be
written down thus; <sup>40</sup>/<sub>77</sub>, <sup>49</sup>/<sub>129</sub>, <sup>20</sup>/<sub>94</sub>, <sup>79</sup>/<sub>81</sub>, 30, <sup>27</sup>/<sub>50</sub>, <sup>41</sup>/<sub>65</sub>, <sup>59</sup>/<sub>65</sub>, 96,
<sup>77</sup>/<sub>47</sub>, <sup>67</sup>/<sub>42</sub>. On axis A a system of wheels, furnished
with tubes revolve, and these tubes carry horizontal
arms, supporting perpendicular stems with
the planets. The wheels on this axis are 173,
<sup>117</sup>/<sub>190</sub>, 111, 119, <sup>122</sup>/<sub>130</sub>, <sup>123</sup>/<sub>127</sub>, 83, 239, 96, 128, 72. From
the following short description the nature of their
several actions will, it is presumed, be readily
understood&mdash;viz.,</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERCURY’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>On the axis ‘C’ at the bottom is
wheel 86, which turns round in 365
days 5<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup>, this wheel impels
a small wheel of 22 teeth, to
which is made fast to wheel 67, both
revolving together at the foot of
axis B; wheel 67 drives a wheel of
72 once round in the period of 87
days, 23<sup>h</sup> 14<sup>m</sup> 36.1<sup>s</sup>: this last mentioned
wheel has a long tube, which
turns on the steel axis A, and carries
a horizontal arm with the
planet Mercury round the sun in
the time above noted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VENUS’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>On axis ‘C’ is wheel 127, which
drives wheel 47, to which is riveted
a wheel of 77 teeth, which impels a
wheel of 128 teeth on axis A, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
causes it to make a revolution in
224 days, 16<sup>h</sup> 41<sup>m</sup> 31.1<sup>s</sup>, and is
furnished with a tube, which revolves
over that of Mercury and ascends
through the cover of the machine,
and bears an arm on which is placed
a small ball representing this planet
in the time stated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EARTH’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The motion of the earth round
the sun is simply effected as follows&mdash;the
assumed value of axis ‘C;’
the ‘Yearly axis’ is 365 days 5<sup>h</sup>
48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup>; hence a system of
wheels having the same numbers of
teeth, or at all events, the first
mover, and last wheel impelled must
be equal in their numbers of teeth;
in this machine three wheels are
employed, thus; a wheel having 96
teeth is made fast to the Yearly axis
C and of course moves round with
it in a mean solar year, as above
noted, this wheel impels another
wheel of 96 teeth, on axis B, and
this in its turns drives a third wheel
of 96 teeth on axis A, and is furnished
with a long tube which revolves
over that of Venus, and
ascends above the cover-plate of the
machine, and bears a horizontal arm
which supports a small terrestrial
globe, which revolves by virtue of
said wheels once round the sun in
365 days 5<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARS’ PERIOD.</div>

<p>The revolution of this planet is
effected as follows&mdash;a wheel of 140
teeth is made fast to the yearly axis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
C, and drives on axis B a wheel of
65 teeth, to which is fixed a wheel
of 59 teeth, which impels a large
wheel of 239 teeth on axis A once
round the sun in 686 days 22<sup>h</sup> 18<sup>m</sup>
33.6<sup>s</sup>, this last-mentioned wheel is
also furnished with a tube which
revolves over that of the earth, and
carries a horizontal arm bearing the
ball representing Mars, and causes
it to complete a revolution round
the sun in the period named.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ASTEROIDS.</i>
VESTA’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The period of Vesta is accomplished
thus, viz. On the Yearly
axis C, is made fast a wheel of 36
teeth, which drives a wheel of 65
teeth on axis B, to which is fixed a
wheel of 41 teeth, which impels a
wheel of 83 teeth on axis A, once
round in 1336 days 0<sup>h</sup> 21<sup>m</sup> 19.8<sup>s</sup>:
The tube of which last wheel ascends
on that of Mars, and like the rest
bears an arm supporting a ball
representing this planet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUNO’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>For the revolution of Juno, the
yearly axis C is furnished with a
wheel of 54 teeth, which impels a
wheel of 50 teeth on axis B, to
which is made fast a wheel of 27
teeth which turns a wheel of 127
teeth on axis A, once round in 1590
days 17<sup>h</sup> 35<sup>m</sup> 2.7<sup>s</sup>, and the tube of
which ascends on that of Vesta, and
supports a horizontal arm which
carries a small ball representing this
planet in the period named.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CERES’
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The revolution of Ceres is derived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
from the period of Juno, because
wheel-work taken from the unit of
a solar year was not sufficiently
accurate for the purpose, therefore on
Juno’s wheel of 127 teeth is fixed a
wheel of 123 teeth, which drives a
thick little bevel sort of wheel of
30 teeth on axis B: the reason of
this small wheel being bevelled is to

turns on the tube of Juno, and ascends
in a similar manner with the
rest and carries an horizontal arm
supporting a small ball representing
this planet, and is caused to revolve
round the Sun in the above mentioned
period (the period of Ceres

hence the wheels used.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">PALLAS’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The Period of Pallas could not be
derived from the solar year with
sufficient accuracy, and recourse was
had to an engrafted fraction on the
period of Ceres, thus. On wheel
130 of Ceres is made fast a wheel of
122 teeth, which drives a wheel of 81
teeth on axis B, to which is fixed a
wheel 79 which impels a wheel of
119 teeth on axis A, and is furnished
with a tube which ascends,
and turns on that of Ceres, and
supports a horizontal arm, which
bears a small ball representing this
planet, which by virtue of the above
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span>
train of wheels is caused to complete
a revolution round the Sun in
1681<sup>d</sup> 10<sup>h</sup> 28<sup>m</sup> 25.1<sup>s</sup>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUPITER’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The motion of this planet is derived
from the period of a solar
year; from the ‘yearly axis’ thus,
on this axis is made fast a wheel of
44 teeth which turns a wheel of 94
teeth on axis B, to which is riveted
a small wheel of 20 teeth, which
impels a wheel on axis A having 111
teeth, which is furnished with an
ascending tube which revolves over
that of Pallas, and bears an horizontal
arm which supports a ball representing
this planet, which by the said
train of wheels is caused to revolve
round the Sun in 4330<sup>d</sup> 14<sup>h</sup> 39<sup>m</sup>
35.7<sup>s</sup>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SATURN’S
PERIOD.</div>

<p>The periodic revolution of Saturn
is also taken from the solar year&mdash;viz.,
a small wheel of 17 teeth is
fixed to the ‘yearly axis’ near its
top, and drives a wheel of 129 teeth
on axis B, to which is made fast a
wheel of 49 teeth, which turns a
wheel of 190 teeth on axis A,
whose tube ascends and revolves on
that of Jupiter’s tube, and supports
an arm, having a ball representing
Saturn and its rings, and which by
the train of wheels is caused to perform
a revolution round the sun in
the period of 10746<sup>d</sup> 19<sup>h</sup> 16<sup>m</sup> 50.9<sup>s</sup>.</p>

<p>URANUS’S
PERIOD.</p>

<p>The revolution of this planet
could not be attained with sufficient
accuracy from the period of a solar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
year&mdash;the period is engrafted on
that of Saturn’s, thus, a wheel of
117 teeth is made fast to wheel 190
of Saturn, and consequently revolves
in Saturn’s period. This wheel of
117 teeth drives a wheel on axis B,
having 77 teeth, to which is fixed a
wheel of 40 teeth, which turns on
axis A, a large wheel of 173 teeth,
whose tube ascends and revolves over
that of Saturn, and carries a horizontal
arm which supports a ball
representing this planet, which is
caused to complete its revolution by
such a train of wheels in the period
of 30589<sup>d</sup> 8<sup>h</sup> 26<sup>m</sup> 58.4<sup>s</sup>. Such is a
brief description of the motions of
this comprehensive and very accurate
machine.</p>

<p>The axis A, on which the planetary tubular
wheels revolve, performs a rotation in 25 days
10  hours, by virtue of the following train of
wheels, <sup>61</sup>/<sub>14</sub> + <sup>70</sup>/<sub>12</sub> of 24 hours, that is, a pinion of 14
is assumed to revolve in 24 hours, and to drive a
wheel of 61 teeth, to which is fixed a pinion of 12,
which turns the wheel 70 in the period noted; to
this wheel-axis, it is made fast, and by revolving
with it, exhibits the Sun’s rotation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIURNAL
HAND.</div>

<p>The machine is turned by a handle
or winch, which is assumed to turn
round in 24 hours, and from this
rotation of 24 hours a train of wheel-work
is required to cause the ‘yearly
axis’ C, to turn once round in 365<sup>d</sup>
5<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup>, which is effected in the
following manner&mdash;viz, the train found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
by the process of the reduction of continuous
fractions is <sup>61</sup>/<sub>14</sub> + <sup>144</sup>/<sub>18</sub> + <sup>211</sup>/<sub>23</sub> that
is, in the train for turning the sun,
the same pinion 14 turns the same
wheel 61, and turns a pinion of 18
leaves, to which is fixed a wheel of
144 teeth, having a pinion of 23
leaves, which impels a large wheel of
241 teeth once round in 365.242236<sup>d</sup>
or 365<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> 48<sup>m</sup> 49.19<sup>s</sup>, this last-mentioned
wheel of 241 teeth is made
fast to the under part of the ‘yearly
axis’ C at D, the handle having a
pinion of 14 leaves therefore, and
transmitting its motion through the
above train, causes the yearly axis to
revolve in the same period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REGISTRATING
DATES.</div>

<p>The planetarium is also furnished
with a system of wheels for registrating
dates for either 10,000 years
past or to come, the arrangement is
not shewn in the engraving (to prevent
confusion) but it might be
shortly described thus:&mdash;Near the top
of the yearly axis is a hooked piece
<i>e</i>, which causes the tooth of a wheel
of 100 teeth to start forward yearly,
consequently 100 starts of said
wheel will cause it to revolve in 100
solar years, and it has a hand which
points on a dial on the cover of the
machine the years; thus for the present
year this hand will be over the
number 45. This last-named wheel
of 100 teeth has a pin which causes
a tooth of another wheel of 100
teeth to start once in 100 years,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span>
hence this last wheel will complete
one revolution in 10,000 years, and it
is for this purpose the former index
or hand moves over a number yearly.
The second index will pass over a
number every 100 years&mdash;for the
present year the second hand or
index will be over the number 18,
and will continue over it until the
first index moves forward to 99,
then both indexes will move at one
time, viz., the first index to 00 on
the first concentric circle of the
dial, and the second index to 19,
denoting the year 1900, and so of
the rest. By the ecliptic being divided
in a series of four spirals, the
machine makes a distinction between
common and leap years, and indicates
the common year as containing
365 days, and the leap-year 366
days, by taking in a day in February
every fourth year; thus for any
given period for 10,000 years past or
to come, the various situations and
aspects of the planets may be ascertained
by operating with this machine,
and this for thousands of years without
producing a sensible error either in
space or time. This planetarium
wheel-work is enclosed in an elegant
mahogany box of twelve sides&mdash;is
about 5 feet in diameter by 10
inches in depth; at each of the
twelve angles, or sides, small brass
pillars rise and support a large
Ecliptic circle on which are engraven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
the signs, degrees and minutes of the
Ecliptic&mdash;the days of the month, &amp;c.
This mahogany box with the wheel-work
is supported by a tripod stand
three feet in height, and motion is
communicated to the several balls
representing the planets by turning
the handle as before described. A
Planetarium of this complicated
sort, costs sixty guineas.</p>

<p>In the month of October last year, Dr. Henderson
made a series of calculations for a new
Planetarium for the use of schools. It shows
with considerable accuracy for 700 days, the mean
tropical revolutions of the Planets round the
sun&mdash;the machine consists of a system of brass
wheels peculiarly arranged, and is enclosed in a
circular case three feet in diameter, the top of
which has the signs and degrees of the ecliptic
laid down on it, as also the days of the months, &amp;c.
This Planetarium costs only 45s. or on a tripod
stand, table-high, 55s.; the machine is put in
motion by a handle on the outside. To the teachers
and others connected with education this Planetarium
must be of great importance, for without
a proper elucidation of the principles of astronomy,
that of Geography must be but confusedly understood.
This Planetarium is at present made
by Mr. Dollond, 9, White Conduit Grove, Islington,
London.</p>

<p>The <i>Tellurian</i> is a small instrument which should
be used in connection with the Planetarium formerly
described. This instrument is intended to show
the annual motion of the earth, and the revolution
of the moon around it. It also illustrates the
moon’s phases, and the motion of her nodes, the
inclination of the Earth’s axis, the causes of
eclipses, the variety of seams, and other phenomena.
It consists of about eight wheels, pinions
and circles. A small instrument of this description
may be purchased for about one pound eight
shillings, as stated in the note, page 527.

</div>

<p>The striking and singular phenomenon connected
with the planet Saturn&mdash;though now
ascertained beyond dispute to be a Ring, or Rings,
surrounding its body at a certain distance&mdash;was a
subject of great mystery, and gave rise to numerous
conjectures and controversies, for a considerable
time after the invention of the telescope by
which it was discovered. Though it was first
discovered in the year 1610, it was nearly 50
years afterwards, before its true form and nature
were determined. Galileo was the first who discovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
anything uncommon connected with
Saturn: through his telescope he thought he saw
that planet appear like two smaller globes on each
side of a larger one; and after viewing the planet
in this form for two years, he was surprised to see
it becoming quite round, without its adjoining
globes, and some time afterwards to appear in the
triple form. This appearance is represented in
fig. 1 of the above engraving. In the year
1614, Scheiner, a German astronomer, published
a representation of Saturn, in which this planet is
exhibited as a large central globe, with two smaller
bodies, one on each side, partly of a conical form,
attached to the planet and forming a part of it, as
shown fig. 2. In the year 1640 and 1643, Ricciolus,
an Italian mathematician and astronomer,
imagined he saw Saturn as represented in fig. 3.
consisting of a central globe, and two conical
shaped bodies completely detached from it, and
published an account of it corresponding to this
view. Hevelius, the celebrated astronomer of
Dantzig, author of the <i>Selenographia</i> and other
works, made many observations on this planet
about the years 1643, 1649 and 1650, in which he
appears to have obtained different views of the
planet and its appendages, gradually approximating
to the truth, but still incorrect. These views
are represented in figures 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Fig. 4 nearly resembles two hemispheres, one on
each side of the globe of Saturn. The other
figures very nearly resemble the extreme parts of
the ring as seen through a good telescope, but he
still seems to have considered them as detached
from each other as well as from Saturn. Figures
8 and 9 are views given by Ricciolus at a
period posterior to that in which he supposed
Saturn and his appendages in the form delineated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span>
in fig. 3. In these last delineations the planet
was supposed to be enclosed in an elliptical ring,
but this ring was supposed to be <i>fixed</i> to its two
opposite sides.</p>

<p>Fig. 10, is a representation by Eustachius Divini,
a celebrated Italian optician at Bologna. The
shades represented on Saturn and the elliptical
curve are incorrect, as this planet presents no such
shadowy form. The general appearance here presented
is not much unlike that which the ring of
Saturn exhibits, excepting that at the upper side the
ring should appear covering a portion of the orb
of Saturn. But Divini seems to have conceived
that the curve on each side was attached to the
body of Saturn. For when Huygens published
his discovery of the ring of Saturn in 1659, Divini
contested its truth, because he could not perceive
the ring through his own telescopes; and he wrote
a treatise on the subject in opposition to Huygens,
in 1660, entitled ‘Brevis Annotatio in Systema
Saturninum.’ Huygens immediately replied to
him, and Divini wrote a rejoinder in 1661.&mdash;Fig.
11  is the representation given by Francis Fontana,
a Neapolitan astronomer. This figure represents
Saturn as having two crescents, one on each side,
attached to its body, with intervals between the
planet and the crescents. Fig. 12 is a view
delineated by Gassendus, a celebrated French philosopher.
It represents the planet as a large ellipsoid,
having a large circular opening near each
end, and, if this representation were the true one,
each opening would be at least 30,000 miles in
diameter. Fig. 13, which is perhaps the most
singular of the whole, is said to be one of the
view’s of this planet given by Ricciolus. It represents
two globes&mdash;each of which, in the proportion
they here bear to Saturn, must be more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span>
thirty thousand miles in diameter. These globes,
were conceived as being attached to the body of
Saturn by curves or bands, each of which, in the
proportion represented, must have been at least
7000 miles in breadth, and nearly 40,000 miles
long. This would have exhibited the planet
Saturn as a still more singular body than what we
have found it to be; but no such construction of a
planet has yet been found in the universe, nor is
it probable that such a form of a planetary body
exists.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that only two general opinions
should have been formed respecting the construction
of Saturn&mdash;as appears from these representations&mdash;either
that this planet was composed of
three distinct parts, separate from each other,&mdash;or
that the appendage on each side was <i>fixed</i> to the
body of the planet. The idea of a ring surrounding
the body of the planet, at a certain distance
from every part of it, seems never to have been
thought of till the celebrated Huygens, in 1655,
1656 and 1657, by numerous observations made on
this planet, completely demonstrated that it is
surrounded by a solid and permanent ring, which
never changes its situation, and, without touching
the body of the planet, accompanies it in its revolution
around the sun. As the cause of all the
erroneous opinions above stated was owing to the
imperfection of the telescopes which were then in
use, and their deficiency in magnifying power,&mdash;this
ingenious astronomer set himself to work in
order to improve telescopes for celestial observations.
He improved the art of grinding and
polishing object-glasses, which he finished with his
own hands, and produced lenses of a more correct
figure, and of a longer focal distance than what
had previously been accomplished. He first constructed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span>
a telescope 12 feet long, and afterwards
one 23 feet long, which magnified about 95 times;
whereas Galileo’s best telescope magnified only
about 33 times. He afterwards constructed one
123 feet long, which magnified about 220 times.
It was used without a tube, the object-glass being
placed upon the top of a pole and connected by a
cord with the eye-piece. With such telescopes
this ingenious artist and mathematician discovered
the fourth satellite of Saturn, and demonstrated
that the phenomenon, which had been so egregiously
misrepresented by preceding astronomers,
consisted of an immense ring surrounding the body,
and completely detached from it. His numerous
observations and reasonings on this subject were
published in Latin, in 1659, in a quarto volume of
nearly 100 pages, entitled ‘<i>Systema Saturnium,
sive de causis mirandorum Saturni Phenomen&ocirc;n,
et Comite ejus Planeta Nova</i>,’ from which work
the figures and some of the facts stated above have
been extracted.</p>

<h4 id="ON_THE_SUPPOSED_DIVISION_OF_THE_EXTERIOR_RING_OF_SATURN">ON THE SUPPOSED DIVISIONS OF THE EXTERIOR
RING OF SATURN.</h4>

<p>From the period in which Huygens lived till the
time when Herschel applied his large telescopes to
the heavens, few discoveries were made in relation
to Saturn. Cassini, in 1671, discovered the fifth
satellite of this planet; in 1672, the third; and
the first and second in March, 1684. In 1675,
Cassini saw the broad side of its ring bisected
quite round by a dark elliptical line, of which the
inner part appeared brighter than the outer. In
1722, Mr. Hadley, with his 5 feet Newtonian
Reflector observed the same phenomenon, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span>
perceived that the dark line was stronger next the
body, and fainter towards the upper edge of the
ring. Within the ring he also discovered two
belts across the disk of Saturn. But it does not
appear that they had any idea that this dark line
was empty space separating the ring into two
parts. This discovery was reserved for the late
Sir W. Herschel, who made numerous observations
on this planet, and likewise ascertained that
the ring performs a revolution round the planet in
ten hours and thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Of late years, some observers have supposed
that the exterior ring of Saturn is divided into
several parts, or, in other words, that it consists of
two or more concentric rings. The following are
some of the observations on which this opinion
is founded. They are chiefly extracted from
Captain Kater’s Paper on this subject, which
was read before the Astronomical Society of
London.</p>

<p>The observations, we are told, were made in the
years 1825 and 1826, and remained unpublished,
from a wish on the part of the observer to witness
the appearances again. The planet Saturn has
been much observed by Captain Kater, for the
purpose of trying the light, &amp;c., for which the
ring and satellites are good tests. The instruments
which were employed in the present investigations
were two Newtonian Reflectors&mdash;one by Watson,
of 40 inches focus and 6&frac14; aperture; and another
by Dollond, of 68 inches focus, and 6&frac34; aperture.
The first, under favourable circumstances, gave a
most excellent image, the latter is a very good
instrument. The following are extracts from the
author’s journal.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 25, 1825.</i>&mdash;The double ring beautifully
defined, perfectly distinct all around, and the principal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
belts well seen. I tried many concave glasses,
and found that the image was much sharper than
with convex eye-glasses, and the light apparently
much greater. Dollond, 259, the best power,
480, a single lens, very distinct. <i>Nov. 30</i>, the night
very favourable, but not equal to the 25th. The
exterior ring of Saturn is not so bright as the interior,
and the interior is less bright close to the
edge next the planet. The inner edge appears
more yellow than the rest of the ring, and nearer
in colour to the body of the planet. <i>Dec. 17</i>.&mdash;The
evening extremely fine. With Dollond, I
perceived the outer ring of Saturn to be darker
than the inner, and the division of the ring all
around with perfect distinctness; but with Watson
I fancied that I saw <i>the outer ring separated by
numerous dark divisions extremely close, one stronger
than the rest, dividing the ring about equally</i>.
This was seen with my most perfect single eye-glass
power. A careful examination of some hours
confirmed this opinion.&mdash;<i>Jan. 16</i> and 17, 1826.&mdash;Captain
Kater believed that he saw the divisions
with the Dollond, but was not positive. Concave
eye-glasses found to be superior to convex. <i>Feb.
26, 1826</i>.&mdash;The division of the outer ring not seen
with Dollond. On the 17th Dec., when the divisions
were most distinctly seen, Captain Kater
made a drawing of the appearance of Saturn and
his rings. The phenomena were witnessed by two
other persons on the same evening, one of whom
saw several divisions in the outer ring, while the
other saw one middle division only; but the latter
person was short-sighted, and unaccustomed to
telescopic observations. It may be remarked, however,
that these divisions were not seen on other
evenings, which yet were considered very favourable
for distinct vision.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">546</span></p>

<p>It is said that the same appearances were seen
by Mr. Short, but the original record of his observations
cannot be found. In Lalande’s <i>Astronomy</i>
(3rd edition, article 3351,) it is said, ‘Cassini remarked
that the breadth of the ring was divided
into two equal parts by a dark line having the
same curvature as the ring, and the <i>exterior</i> portion
was the less bright. Short <i>told</i> me that he
observed still more singular phenomena with his
large telescope of 12 feet. The breadth of the
ans&aelig;, or extremities of the ring; was, according
to him, divided into two parts,&mdash;an inner portion
without any break in the illumination, and an
outer divided by several lines concentric with the
circumference; which would lead to a belief, <i>that
there are several rings in the same plane</i>.’ De
Lambre and Birt severally state that Short saw the
outer ring divided, probably on the authority of
Lalande. In Brewster’s <i>Ferguson’s Astronomy</i>,
vol. ii, p. 125, 2nd edition, there is the following
note on this subject. ‘Mr. Short assures us, that
with an excellent telescope, he observed the surface
of the ring divided by several dark concentric
lines, which seem to indicate a number of rings
proportional to the number of dark lines which he
perceived.’</p>

<p>In Dec. 1813, at Paris, Professor Quetelet saw
the outer ring divided with the achromatic telescope
of 10 inches aperture, which was exhibited
at the exposition. He mentioned this the following
day to M. de la Place, who observed, that
‘those or even more divisions, were conformable to
the system of the world.’ On the other hand the
division of the outer ring was not seen by Sir W.
Herschel in 1792, nor by Sir J. Herschel in 1826,
nor by Struve in the same year; and on several
occasions when the atmospheric conditions were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">547</span>
most favourable, it has not been seen by Captain
Kater. It has been remarked by Sir W. Herschel,
Struve and others, that the exterior ring is much
less brilliant than the interior. And it is asked,
may not this want of light in the outer ring arise
from its having a very dense atmosphere? and may
not this atmosphere in certain states admit of the
divisions of the exterior ring being seen, though,
under other circumstances, they remain invisible?
The above observations are said to have been confirmed
by some recent observations by Decuppis at
Rome, who announced, some years ago, that Saturn’s
outer ring is divided into two or three concentric
rings.</p>

<p>Some of the observations stated above, were
they perfectly correct, would lead to the conclusion
that Saturn is encompassed with a number of
rings, concentric with and parallel to each other.
But while such phenomena as described above
are so seldom seen, even by the most powerful
telescopes and the most accurate observers, a certain
degree of doubt must still hang over the
subject; and we must suspend our opinion on this
point, till future observations shall either confirm
or render doubtful those to which we have referred.
Should the Earl of Rosse’s great telescope, when
finished for observation, be found to perform according
to the expectations now entertained, and
in proportion to its size and quantity of light, we
shall expect that our doubts will be resolved in
regard to the supposed divisions of the ring of
Saturn.

<h3 id="DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_EARL_OF_ROSSES_TELESCOPE">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EARL OF ROSSE’S TELESCOPE.</h3>

<p>This telescope, the largest and most magnificent
that ever was attempted, reflects the greatest
honour on the genius, the inventive powers, and
the scientific acquirements of its noble contriver,
as well as on the elevated station in which he is
placed. With rank and fortune, and every circumstance
that usually unfit men for scientific
pursuit, he has set a bright example to his compeers
of the dignity and utility of philosophical
studies and investigations, and of the aids they
might render to the progress of science, were
their wealth and pursuits directed in a proper
channel.</p>

<p>Previously to his Lordship’s attempting the
construction of his largest&mdash;or ‘Monster Telescope,’
he had constructed one with a speculum of
3 feet in diameter, which was considered one of
the most accurate and powerful instruments that
had ever been made, not excepting even Sir W.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
Herschel’s forty-feet Reflector. In the account
of this telescope, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1840, his Lordship speaks of the
possibility of a speculum of six feet in diameter
being cast. At that time, it was considered by
some as little short of a chimera to attempt the
construction of such a monstrous instrument. But
the idea no sooner occurred to this ingenious and
persevering nobleman than he determined to put
it to the test, and the result has been attended
with complete success. The materials of which
this speculum is composed are <i>copper</i> and <i>tin</i>,
united very nearly in their atomic proportions,
namely, copper 126.4 parts, to tin 58.9 parts.
This compound has a specific gravity of 8.8, and
it is found to preserve its lustre with more splendor,
and to be more free from pores than any
other. A foundry was constructed expressly for
the purpose of casting the speculum. Its chimney
built from the ground was 18 feet high, and 16&frac12;
square at the base, tapering to four at the top.
At each of its sides, communicating with it by
flue, was sunk a furnace 8 feet deep, and 5&frac12;
square, with a circular opening 4 feet in diameter.
About seven feet from the chimney was erected a
large crane, with the necessary tackle for elevating
and carrying the crucibles from the furnace to the
mould, which was placed in a line with the chimney
and crane, and had three iron baskets supported
on pivots hung round it; and four feet farther
on was the annealing oven. The crucibles
which contained the metal were each 2 feet in
diameter, 2&frac12; deep, and together weighed one ton
and a half; they were of cast iron and made to
fit the baskets at the side of the mould. These
baskets were hung on wooden uprights or pivots,
to one of these on each side was attached a lever,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span>
by depressing which it might be turned over, and
the contents of the crucible poured into the
mould. The bottom of the mould was made by
binding together tightly layers of hoop-iron, and
turning the required shape on them edgewise.
This mould conducted the heat away through the
bottom, and cooled the metal towards the top in
infinitely small layers, while the interstices, though
close enough to prevent the metal from escaping,
were sufficiently open to allow the air to penetrate.
This bottom was six feet in diameter and 5&frac12; inches
thick, and was made perfectly horizontal by means
of spirit levels, and was surrounded by a wooden
frame; a wooden pattern, the exact size of the
speculum, being placed on the iron; sand was well
packed between it and the frame, and the pattern
was removed. Each of the crucibles containing
the melted metal was then placed in its basket,
and every thing being ready for discharging their
contents, they were at the same instant turned
over, and the mould being filled, the metal in a
short time safely set into the required figure.
Whilst it was red hot, and scarcely solid, the
frame-work was removed, and an iron ring connected
with a bar which passed through the oven,
being placed round it, it was drawn in by means
of a capstan at the other side, on a railroad, when
charcoal being lighted in the oven, and turf fires
underneath it, all the openings were built up, and
it was left for sixteen weeks to anneal. It was
cast on the 13th of April, 1842, at 9 o’clock in
the evening. The crucibles were ten hours heating
in the furnaces before the metal was introduced,
which in about ten hours more was sufficiently
fluid to be poured. When the oven was
opened the speculum was found as perfect as when
it entered it. It was then removed to the grinding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span>
machine, where it underwent that process, and
afterwards was polished, without any accident
having occurred.</p>

<p>This speculum weighed <i>three tons</i>, and lost
about one eighth of an inch in grinding. Lord
Rosse has since cast another speculum of the
same diameter four tons in weight. He can now,
with perfect confidence, undertake any casting, so
great an improvement has the form of mould
which he has invented proved. The speculum
was placed on an equilibrium bed, composed of
nine pieces resting on points at their centres of
gravity; the pieces were lined with pitch and
felt, before the speculum was placed on them.
The speculum box is also lined with felt and
pitched; this prevents any sudden change of temperature
affecting the speculum by means of the
bad conducting power of the substances employed.
A vessel of lime is kept in connection with the
speculum-box to absorb the moisture, which
otherwise might injure the mirror. The process
of grinding was conducted under water, and the
moving power employed was a steam-engine of
three-horse power. The Polisher is connected
with the machinery by means of a large ring of
iron, which loosely encircles it; and instead of
either the speculum or the polisher being stationary,
both move with a regulated speed; the
ring of the polisher, and therefore the polisher
itself, has a transverse and a longitudinal motion;
it makes 80 strokes in the minute, and 24&frac12; strokes
backward and forward for every revolution of the
mirror, and at the same time 1<sup>72</sup>/<sub>100</sub> strokes in the
transverse direction. The extent of the latter is
<sup>27</sup>/<sub>100</sub> of the diameter of the speculum. The substance
made use of to wear down the surface was
emery and water, a constant supply of these was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span>
kept between the grinder and the speculum. The
Grinder is made of cast iron, with grooves cut
lengthways, across and circularly on its face. The
polisher and speculum have a mutual action upon
each other; in a few hours, by the help of the
emery and water, they are both ground truly circular,
whatever may have been their previous
defects. The grinding is continued till the required
form of surface is produced; and this is
ascertained in the following manner. There is a
high tower over the house in which the speculum
is ground, on the top of which is fixed a pole, to
which is attached the dial of a watch; there are
trap doors which open, and by means of a temporary
eye-piece, allow the figure of the dial to
be seen in the speculum brought to a slight polish.
If the dots on the dial are not sufficiently well-defined,
the grinding is continued; but if they
appear satisfactorily, the polishing is commenced.
It required six weeks to grind it to a fair surface.
The polisher was cut into grooves, to prevent the
abraded matter from accumulating in some places
more than in others&mdash;a thin layer of pitch was
spread over it, it was smeared over with rouge and
water, and a supply of it kept up till the machinery
brought it to a fine black polish. The length
of time employed for polishing the 3 feet speculum
was six hours.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>This large telescope is now completed, or nearly
so. The tube is 56 feet long, including the speculum
box, and is made of deal, one inch thick,
hooped with iron. On the inside, at intervals of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
8 feet, there are rings of iron 3 inches in depth
and 1 inch broad, for the purpose of strengthening
the sides. The diameter of the tube is 7 feet. It
is fixed to mason-work, in the ground, to a large
universal hinge which allows it to turn in all directions.
At 12 feet distance, on each side, a wall
is built, 72 feet long, 48 high on the outer side,
and 56 on the inner&mdash;the walls being 24 feet distant
from each other, and lying exactly in the
meridional line. When directed to the south, the
tube may be lowered till it become almost horizontal;
but when pointed to the north, it only
falls till it is parallel with the earth’s axis, pointing
then to the pole of the heavens. Its lateral
movements take place only from wall to wall, and
this commands a view for half an hour on each
side of the meridian&mdash;that is, the whole of its
motion from east to west is limited to 15 degrees.
At present it is fitted up in a temporary way to
be used as a Transit instrument; but it is ultimately
intended to connect with the tube-end
galleries, machinery which shall give an automaton
movement, so that the telescope shall be used as
an Equatorial Instrument. All the works connected
with this instrument are of the strongest
and safest kind; all the iron-work was cast in his
Lordship’s laboratory by men instructed by himself,
and every part of the machinery was made
under his own eye, by the artizans in his own
neighbourhood, and not a single accident worth
mentioning happened during the whole proceeding.</p>

<p>The expence incurred by his Lordship in the
erection of this noble instrument was not less than
<i>twelve thousand pounds</i>! besides the money expended
in the construction of the telescope of
three feet diameter. Sufficient time has not yet been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span>
afforded for making particular observations with
this telescope; but from slight trials which have
been made, even under unfavourable circumstances,
it promises important results. Its great superiority
over every telescope previously constructed
consists in the great quantity of light it reflects,
and the brilliancy with which it exhibits objects
even when high powers are applied. It has a reflecting
surface of 4,071 square inches, while that
of Herschel’s 40-feet telescope had only 1811
square inches on its polished surface, so that the
quantity of light reflected from the speculum is
considerably more than double that of Herschel’s
largest reflector. This instrument has already
exceeded his Lordship’s expectations. Many appearances
before invisible in the Moon, have been
perceived, and there is every reason to expect
that new discoveries will be made by it in the
<i>Nebul&aelig;</i>, double and triple stars, and other celestial
objects. The following is an extract of a communication
from Sir James South, on this subject,
addressed to the Editor of the ‘<i>Times</i>.’ ‘The
leviathan telescope on which the Earl of Rosse
has been toiling upwards of two years, although
not absolutely finished, was on Wednesday last
directed to the Sidereal Heavens. The letter
which I have this morning received from its noble
maker, in his usual unassuming stile, merely
states, that the metal only just polished, was of a
pretty good figure, and that with a power of 500,
the nebula known as No. 2., of Messier’s catalogue,
was even more magnificent than the nebula,
No. 13 of Messier, when seen with his Lordship’s
telescope of 3 feet diameter, and 27 feet focus.
Cloudy weather prevented him from turning the
leviathan on any other nebulous object. Thus,
then, we have all danger of the metal breaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span>
before it could be polished, overcome. Little
more, however, will be done with it for some time,
as the Earl is on the eve of quitting Ireland for
England to resign his post at York as President
of the British Association. I look forward with
intense anxiety to witness its first severe trial,
when all its various appointments shall be completed,
in the confidence that those who may then
be present, will see with it what man has never
seen before. The diameter of the large metal
is 6-feet, and its focus 54 feet; yet the immense
mass is manageable by one man. Compared with
it, the working telescopes of Sir William Herschel,
which in his hands conferred on astronomy such
inestimable service, and on himself astronomical
immortality, were but playthings.’</p>

<p>The following is a more recent account of observations
made by this telescope, chiefly extracted
from Sir James South’s description of this telescope,
inserted in the <i>Times</i> of April 16th, 1845,
and the ‘<i>Illustrated London News</i>’ of April 19.</p>

<p>‘The night of the 5th of March, 1845, was the
finest I ever saw in Ireland. Many nebul&aelig; were
observed by Lord Rosse, Dr. Robinson and
myself. Most of them were for the first time
since their creation, seen by us as groups or clusters
of stars; while some, at least to my eyes, showed
no such resolution. Never, however, in my life
did I see such glorious sidereal pictures as this
instrument afforded us. Most of the nebul&aelig; we
saw I certainly have observed with my own large
achromatic; but although that instrument, as far
as relates to magnifying power, is probably inferior
to no one in existence, yet to compare these
nebul&aelig;, as seen with it and the 6-feet telescope,
is like comparing, as seen with the naked eye, the
dinginess of the planet Saturn to the brilliancy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span>
of Venus. The most popularly-known nebul&aelig;
observed this night were the ring nebul&aelig; in the
<i>Canes Venatici</i>, or the 51st of Messier’s catalogue,
which was resolved into stars with a magnifying
power of 548, and the 94th of Messier,
which is in the same constellation, and which was
resolved into a large globular cluster of stars, not
much unlike the well-known cluster in Hercules,
called also 13th Messier.’ Perfection of figure,
however, of a telescope, must be tested, not by
nebul&aelig;, but by its performance on a star of the
first magnitude. If it will, under high power,
show the star round and free from optical appendages,
we may safely take it for granted it will
not only show nebul&aelig; well, but any other celestial
object as it ought. To determine this point, the
telescope was directed to <i>Regulus</i>, with the entire
aperture, and a power of 800, and ‘I saw’ says
Sir James, ‘with inexpressible delight, the star
free from wings, tails or optical appendages; not
indeed like a planetary disk, as in my large achromatic,
but as a round image resembling voltaic
light between charcoal points; and so little aberration
had this brilliant image, that I could have
measured its distance from, and position with any
of the stars in the field with a spider’s line micrometer,
and a power of 1,000, without the slightest
difficulty; for, not only was the large star round,
but the telescope, although in the open air, and
the wind blowing rather fresh, was as steady as a
rock.’</p>

<p>‘On subsequent nights, observations of other
nebul&aelig;, amounting to some 30 or more, removed
most of them from the list of nebul&aelig;, where they
had long figured, to that of clusters; while some
of these latter, more especially 5 Messier, exhibited
a sidereal picture in the telescope such as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span>
man before had never seen, and which for its magnificence
baffles all description. Several double
stars were seen with various apertures of the telescope,
and with powers between 360 and 800;
and as the Earl had told us before we should,&mdash;before
the speculum was inserted in the tube, in
consequence of his having been obliged to quit
the superintendence of the polishing at the most
critical part of the process,&mdash;we found that a ring
of about 6 inches broad, reckoning from the circumference
of the speculum, was not perfectly
polished, and to <i>that</i> the little irradiation seen
about Regulus was unquestionably referable. The
only double stars of the 1st class which the weather
permitted us to examine with it were Xi Urs&aelig;
Majoris, and Gamma Virginis, which I could
have measured with the greatest confidence.
D’Arrest’s comet we observed on the 12th of
March, with a power of 400, but nothing worthy
of notice was detected. Of the Moon, a few
words must suffice. Its appearance in my large
achromatic of 12 inches aperture is known to hundreds
of readers; let them then imagine that with
it they look <i>at</i> the moon, whilst with Lord
Rosse’s 6 feet they look <i>into it</i>, and they will not
form a very erroneous opinion of the performance
of the Leviathan. On the 15th of March, when
the moon was 7 days old, I never saw her unilluminated
disk so beautifully, nor her mountains so
temptingly measurable. On my first looking into
the telescope, a star of about the 7th magnitude
was some minutes of a degree from the moon’s
dark limb, and its occultation by the moon appeared
inevitable. The star, however, instead of
disappearing the moment the moon’s edge came in
contact with it, apparently glided on the moon’s
dark face, as if it had been seen through a transparent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span>
moon, or as if the star were between me
and the moon. It remained on the moon’s disk
nearly two seconds of time, and then disappeared.
I have seen this apparent projection of a star on
the moon’s face several times, but from the great
brilliancy of the star, this was the most beautiful
I ever saw. The cause of this phenomenon is
involved in impenetrable mystery.’</p>

<p>The following is a representation of the Great
Rosse Telescope, along with part of the buildings
with which it is connected. In the interior face
of the eastern wall a very strong iron arc of about
43 feet radius is firmly fixed, provided with adjustments,
whereby its surface facing the telescope
may be set very accurately in the plane of the
meridian. On this bar, lines are drawn, the interval
between any adjoining two of which, corresponds
to one minute of time on the Equator.
The tube and speculum, including the bed on
which the speculum rests, weigh about 15 tons.
The telescope rests on an universal joint placed on
masonry about 6 feet below the ground, and is
elevated or depressed by a chain and windlass;
and although it weighs about 15 tons, the instrument
is raised by two men with great facility. Of
course, it is counterpoised in every direction. The
observer when at work, stands in one of four galleries,
the three highest of which are drawn out
from the western wall, while the fourth or lowest
has for its base an elevating platform, along the
horizontal surface of which a gallery slides from
wall to wall by a machinery within the observer’s
reach, but which a child may work. When the
telescope is about half an hour east of the meridian,
the galleries, hanging over the gap between
the walls, present to a spectator below an appearance
somewhat dangerous; yet the observer, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span>
common prudence, is as safe as on the ground, and
each of the galleries can be drawn from the wall
to the telescope’s side so readily, that the observer
needs no one else to move it for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption"><i>figure 98.</i></p>
<img id="fig098" src="images/fig098.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The above figure represents only the upper
part of the tube of the telescope, at which the
observer stands when making his observations.
The telescope is at present of the Newtonian construction,
and consequently, the observer looks
into the side of the tube at the upper end of the
telescope, but it is proposed to throw aside the
plane speculum, and to adapt it to the <i>Front view</i>,
on the plan already described (see pp. 306, 313,
&amp;c.) so that the observer will sit or stand with his
back towards the object, and his face looking
down upon the speculum; and, in this position,
he will sometimes be elevated between 50 and 60
feet above the ground. As yet, the telescope has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span>
no equatorial motion, but it very shortly will;
and at no very distant day, clock-work will be
connected with it, when the observer will, while
observing, be almost as comfortable, as if he were
reading at a desk by his fire-side.</p>

machinery connected with this telescope. It

the mason-work on the ground, B the universal
joint, which allows the tube to turn in all directions;
C the speculum in its tube; D the box; E
the eye-piece; F the moveable pulley; G the
fixed one; H the chain from the side of the tube;
I the chain from the beam; K the counterpoise;
L the lever; M the chain connecting it with the
tube; Z the chain which passes from the tube to
the windlass over a pulley on a truss-beam which
runs from W to the same situation on the opposite
wall&mdash;the pulley is not seen. X is a railroad on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span>
which the speculum is drawn either to or from its
box; part is cut away to show the counterpoise.
The dotted line <i>a</i> represents the course of the
weight R as the tube rises or falls; it is a segment
of a circle of which the chain I is the radius.
The tube is moved from wall to wall by the
ratchet and wheel at R; the wheel is turned by
the handle O, and the ratchet is fixed to the circle
on the wall. The ladders in front, as shown in
the preceding sketch, enable the observer to
follow the tube in its ascent to where the galleries
on the side wall commence; these side galleries
are three in number, and each can be moved from
wall to wall by the observer, after the tube, the
motion of which he also accomplishes by means of
the handle O.</p>

<p>I shall conclude the description of this wonderful
instrument in the words of Sir James South.</p>

<p>‘What will be the power of this telescope when
it has its Le Mairean form’ [that is, when it is
fitted up with the front view] ‘it is not easy to
divine;&mdash;what nebul&aelig; will it resolve into stars;
in what nebul&aelig; will it not find stars;&mdash;how many
satellites of Saturn will it show us;&mdash;how many
will it indicate as appertaining to Uranus;&mdash;how
many nebul&aelig; never yet seen by mortal eye, will
it present to us;&mdash;what spots will it show us on
the various planets; will it tell us what causes the
variable brightness of many of the fixed stars;&mdash;will
it give us any information as to the constitution
of the planetary nebul&aelig;;&mdash;will it exhibit to
us any satellites encircling them; will it tell us
why the satellites of Jupiter, which generally pass
over Jupiter’s face as disks nearly of white light,
sometimes traverse it as black patches;&mdash;will it
add to our knowledge of the physical construction
of nebulous stars;&mdash;of that mysterious class of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span>
bodies which surround some stars, called, for want
of a better name, ‘photospheres;’&mdash;will it show
the annular nebul&aelig; of Lyra, merely as a brilliant
luminous ring, or will it exhibit it as thousands of
stars arranged in all the symmetry of an ellipse;
will it enable us to comprehend the hitherto incomprehensible
nature and origin of the light of
the great nebul&aelig; of Orion;&mdash;will it give us,
in easily appreciable quantity, the parallax of
some of the fixed stars, or will it make sensible to
us the parallax of the nebulae themselves;&mdash;finally,
having presented to us original portraits of
the moon and of the sidereal heavens, such as man
has never dared even to anticipate&mdash;will it, by
Daguerreotype aid, administer to us copies
founded upon truth, and enable astronomers of
future ages to compare the moon and heavens as
they then may be, with the moon and heavens as
they were? Some of these questions will be answered
affirmatively, others negatively, and that,
too, very shortly; for the noble maker of the
noblest instrument ever formed by man, “has cast
his bread upon the waters, and will, with God’s
blessing, find it before many days.”’

<h3 id="HINTS_TO_AMATEURS_IN_ASTRONOMY_RESPECTING_THE_CONSTRUCTION_OF_TELESCOPES">HINTS TO AMATEURS IN ASTRONOMY RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF TELESCOPES.</h3>

<p>As there are many among the lower ranks of the
community who have a desire to be possessed of a
telescope, which will show them some of the
prominent features of celestial scenery, but who
are unable to purchase a finished instrument at
the prices usually charged by Opticians, the following
hints may perhaps be acceptable to those
who are possessed of a mechanical genius.</p>

<p>The lenses of an Achromatic telescope may be
purchased separately from glass-grinders or Opticians,
and tubes of a cheap material may be prepared
by the individual himself for receiving the
glasses. The following are the prices at which
achromatic object-glasses for astronomical telescopes
are generally sold. Focal length 30 inches,
diameter 2&frac14; inches, from 2 to 3&frac12; guineas. Focal
length 42 inches, diameter 2&frac34; inches, from 5 to 8
guineas. Focal length 42 inches, diameter 3&frac14;
inches, from 12 to 20 guineas. Focal length 42
inches, diameter 3&frac34; inches, from 25 to 30 guineas.
Eye-pieces, from 10s. 6d. to 18 shillings. The
smallest of these lenses, namely that of 2&frac14; inches
diameter, if truly achromatic, may be made to
bear a power of from 80 to 100 times, in clear
weather, for celestial objects, which will show
Jupiter’s moons and belts, Saturn’s ring and other
celestial phenomena. The tubes may be made
either of tin plates, <i>papier mach&eacute;</i>, or wood.
Wood, however, is rather a clumsy article, and it
is sometimes liable to warp, yet excellent tubes
have sometimes been made of it. Perhaps the
cheapest and most convenient of all tubes when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
properly made, are those formed of paper. In
forming these a wooden roller of the proper diameter
should be procured, and paper of a proper
size, along with book-binder’s paste. About
three or four layers only of the paper should be
pasted at one time, and, when sufficiently dry, it
should be smoothed by rubbing it with a smooth
stick or ruler; after which another series of layers
should be pasted on, and allowed to dry as before,
and so on till the tube has acquired a sufficient
degree of strength and firmness. In this way, I
have, by means of a few old Newspapers, and
similar materials, formed tubes as strong as if they
had been made of wood. If several tubes be intended
to slide into each other, the smallest tube
should be made first, and it will serve as a roller
for forming the tube into which it is to slide.</p>

<p>An achromatic object glass of a shorter focal
distance, and a smaller diameter than any of those
stated above, may be fitted up as a useful astronomical
telescope, when a better instrument cannot
be procured. In the Pawn-broker’s shops in
London, and other places, an old achromatic telescope,
with an object-glass 20 inches focal distance
and about 1&frac12; inch diameter, may be purchased
at a price varying from 15 to 20 shillings.
By applying an astronomical eye-piece to such a
lens, if a good one, it may bear a power, for celestial
objects, of 50 or 60 times. If two plano-convex
glasses, &frac34; inch focal distance, be placed
with their convex sides near to each other, they
will form an eye-piece which will produce a power
on such an object-glass, of above 50 times, which
will show Jupiter’s belts and satellites, Saturn’s
ring, the solar spots, and the mountains and
cavities of the moon. I have an object-glass of
this description which belonged to an old telescope,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span>
which cost me only 12 shillings, and with
which I formerly made some useful astronomical
observations. It was afterwards used as the telescope
of a small Equatorial instrument, and, with
it, I was enabled to perceive stars of the first and
second magnitude, and the planets Venus, Jupiter,
and Mars, in <i>the day-time</i>.</p>

<p>But, should such a glass be still beyond the
reach of the astronomical amateur, let him not
altogether despair. He may purchase a single
lens, 3 feet focal distance, for about a couple of
shillings, and by applying an eye-glass of 1 inch
focus, which may be procured for a shilling, he
will obtain a power of 36 times, which is a higher
power than Galileo was able to apply to his best
telescope; and consequently, with such an instrument,
he will be enabled to perceive all the celestial
objects which that celebrated astronomer first
described, and which excited so much wonder, at
that period, in the learned world. But, whatever
kind of telescope may be used, it is essentially
requisite that it be placed on a firm stand in all
celestial observations: and any common mechanic
can easily form such a stand at a trifling expence.</p>

<p>There is a certain optical illusion to which most
persons are subject, in the first use of telescopes,
especially when applied to the celestial bodies, on
which it may not be improper to make a remark.
The illusion to which I allude is this&mdash;that they
are apt to imagine, the telescope does not magnify
nearly so much as it really does. They are apt
to complain of the small appearance which Jupiter
and Saturn, for example, present when magnified
160 or 200 times. With such powers they are
apt to imagine, that these bodies do not appear so
large as the moon to the naked eye. Yet it can
be proved that Jupiter, when nearest the earth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
viewed with such a power, appears about 5 times
the diameter of the full moon, and 25 times larger
in surface. This appears from the following calculation.
Jupiter, when in opposition, or nearest
the Earth, presents a diameter of 47&acute;&acute;: the mean
apparent diameter of the moon is about 31&acute;.
Multiply the diameter of Jupiter by the magnifying
power, 200, the product is 9400&acute;&acute; or 156&acute; or 2&deg;
36&acute;, which, divided by 31&acute;, the moon’s diameter,
produces a quotient of 5, showing that this planet
with such a power appears five times larger in
diameter than the full moon to the naked eye, and
consequently 25 times larger in surface. Were a
power of only 50 times applied to Jupiter, when
nearest the earth, that planet would appear somewhat
larger than the full moon. For 47&acute;&acute; multiplied
by 50 gives 2350&acute;&acute; or 39&acute;, which is 8&acute; more
than the diameter of the moon. Yet with such a
power most persons would imagine that the planet
does not appear one third of the size of the full
moon.</p>

<p>The principal mode by which a person may be
experimentally convinced of the fallacy to which
I allude is the following:&mdash;At a time when Jupiter
happens to be within a few degrees of the moon,
let the planet be viewed through the telescope
with the one eye, and the magnified image of the
planet be brought into contact with the moon as
seen with the other eye&mdash;the one eye looking at
the moon, and the other viewing the magnified
image of Jupiter through the telescope when
brought into apparent contact with the moon&mdash;then
it will be perceived, that with a magnifying
power of 50 the image of Jupiter will completely
cover the moon as seen by the naked eye;&mdash;and
with a power of 200&mdash;when the moon is made to
appear in the centre of the magnified image of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
planet&mdash;it will be seen that Jupiter forms a large
and broad circle around the moon, appearing at
least 5 times greater than the diameter of the
moon. This experiment may be varied as follows:
Suppose a person to view the moon through a
small telescope or opera-glass, magnifying three
times, he will be apt to imagine, at first sight, that
she is not in the least magnified, but rather somewhat
diminished. But let him bring the image as
seen in the telescope in contact with the moon as
seen with the naked eye, and he will plainly perceive
the magnifying power, by the size of the
image. It may be difficult in the first instance to
look, at the same time, at the magnified image and
the real object, but a few trials will render it easy.</p>

 Those unfortunate individuals who have been confined in the
darkest dungeons have declared, that though on their first entrance,
no object could be perceived, perhaps for a day or two, yet, in the
course of time, as the pupils of their eyes expanded, they could
readily perceive mice, rats, and other animals that infested their cells,
and likewise the walls of their apartments; which shows that, even
in such situations, light is present, and produces a certain degree of

 Light of a phosphoric nature, is frequently emitted from various
putrescent animal substances which, in the ages of superstition,
served to astonish and affright the timorous. We learn from Fabricius,
an Italian, that three young men, residing at Padua, having
bought a lamb, and eaten part of it on Easter Day, 1592, several
pieces of the remainder which they kept till the following day, shone
like so many candles when they were casually viewed in the dark.
The astonishment of the whole city was excited by this phenomenon,
and a part of the flesh was sent to Fabricius, who was Professor of
anatomy, to be examined by him. He observed, that those parts which
were soft to the touch and transparent in candle-light, were the most
resplendent: and also that some pieces of kid’s flesh which had happened
to have lain in contact with them were luminous, as well as the
fingers and other parts of the bodies of those persons who touched
them. Bartholin gives an account of a similar phenomenon, which
happened at Montpelier in 1641. A poor woman had bought a piece
of flesh in the market, intending to make use of it the following day,
but happening not to be able to sleep well that night, and her bed and
pantry being in the same room, she observed so much light come from
the flesh as to illuminate all the place where it hung. We may judge
of the terror and astonishment of the woman herself, when we find
that a part of this luminous flesh was carried as a very extraordinary
curiosity to Henry, Duke of Conde, the Governor of the place, who
viewed it several hours with the greatest astonishment. The light
was as if gems had been scattered over the surface, and continued
till the flesh began to putrify, when it vanished, which it was believed
to do in the form of a cross. Hence the propriety of instructing
the mass of the community in the knowledge of the facts connected
with the material system, and the physical causes of the various
phenomena of nature.</p></div>

 This mode of finding the focus of a concave lens may be varied as
follows:&mdash;let the lens be covered with paper, having two small circular
holes; and on the paper for receiving the light, describe also two small
circles, but with their centres at twice the distance from each other of
the centres of the circles. Then move the paper to and from, till the
middle of the sun’s light, coming through the holes, falls exactly on
the middle of the circles; that distance of the paper from the lens will
be the focal length required.</p></div>

 Small glass mirrors for performing some of the experiments, and
illustrating some of the principles above alluded to,&mdash;may be made
of the flattest kind of common watch glasses, by foliating or covering
with tin leaf and quicksilver the convex surfaces of such glasses. Their
focal distances will generally be from one to two inches. Such mirrors
afford a very large and beautiful view of the eye, when held
within their focal distance of that organ. Such mirrors will also serve
the purpose of reflecting light on the objects viewed by microscopes.
Larger mirrors, of from four to eight inches diameter, may be had of
the optician at different prices varying from five to ten or fifteen shillings.</p></div>

 There can be little doubt that some of the facts ascribed, in the

 Fraunhofer was in the highest sense of the word, an <i>Optician</i>, an
original discoverer in the most abstruse and delicate departments of
this science&mdash;a competent mathematician, an admirable mechanist,
and a man of a truly philosophical turn of mind. By his extraordinary
talents, he was soon raised from the lowest station in a manufacturing
establishment to the direction of the <i>optical</i> department of
the business, in which he originally laboured as an ordinary workman.
He then applied the whole power of his mind to the perfection of the
achromatic telescope, the defects of which in reference to the optical
properties of the materials used&mdash;he attempted to remedy; and by a
series of admirable experiments, succeeded in giving to optical determinations,
the precision of astronomical observations, surpassing, in
this respect all who had gone before him, except perhaps, the illustrious
Newton. It was in the course of these researches, that he was
led to the important discovery of the dark lines which occur in the
solar spectrum. His achromatic telescopes are scattered over Europe,
and are the largest and best that have hitherto been constructed. He
died at Munich, at a premature age, in 1826; his death, it is said
being accelerated by the unwholesome nature of the processes employed
in his glass-house; leaving behind him a reputation rarely attained
by one so young. His Memoir “On the refractive and dispersive
power of different species of glass, in reference to the improvement of
Achromatic telescopes, and an account of the lines on the spectrum,”
will be found in the “Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,” Vol. ix. pp.
288-299, and Vol. x. pp. 26-40, for 1823-4.</p></div>

 It is a question which has been frequently started&mdash;Whether there
was any rainbow before the flood? Some have conceived that the
rainbow was something of a <i>miraculous</i> production, and that it was
never seen before the flood. The equivocal sense of the word ‘set’ in
our translation, has occasioned a mistaken impression of this kind. The
Hebrew word thus translated, signifies more properly ‘I do give,’ or
‘I <i>appoint</i>.’ The whole passage in reference to this circumstance,
literally translated, runs thus;&mdash;“I appoint my bow which is in the
cloud, that it may be for a sign or token of a covenant between me
and the earth; and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over
the earth, and the bow shall be seen in the cloud, that I will remember
my covenant that is between me and you,” &amp;c. As the rainbow
is produced by the immutable laws of refraction and reflection, as
applied to the rays of the sun striking on drops of falling rain, the
phenomenon must have been occasionally exhibited from the beginning
of the world: unless we suppose that there was no rain before the
flood, and that the constitution of things in the physical system was
very different from what it is now. The passage affirms no more than
that the rainbow was <i>then appointed</i> to be a <i>symbol</i> of the covenant between
God and man, and although it may have been frequently seen
before, it would serve the purpose of a sign equally well, as if it had
been miraculously formed for this purpose, and even better, as its
frequent appearance, according to natural laws, is a perpetual memorial
to man of the divine faithfulness and mercy.</p></div>

 Miss Short, who has erected and who superintends an observatory
on the Calton hill, Edinburgh, is the descendant of a brother of
Mr. Short. She is in possession of a large Gregorian reflector, about
12 feet long, made by Mr. Short, and mounted on an Equatorial axis.
It was originally placed in a small observatory erected on the Calton
hill, about the year 1776, but for many years past it has been little used.</p></div>

 In using telescopes within doors, care should generally be taken,
that there be no fires in the apartment where they are placed for observation,
and that the air within be nearly of the same temperature
as the air of the surrounding atmosphere; for if the room be filled
with heated air, when the windows are opened, there will be a current
of cold air rushing in, and of heated air rushing out, which will
produce such an undulation and tremulous motion, as will prevent any
celestial object from being distinctly seen.</p></div>

 The distance of Saturn from the sun is 906,000,000 of miles; it
is sometimes nearer to and at other times farther from the earth, according
as it is near the point of its opposition to, or conjunction with
the sun. If this number be divided by 200, the supposed magnifying
power of the telescope, the quotient is 4,530,000, which expresses the
distance in miles at which it enables us to contemplate this planet.
If this number be subtracted from 906,000,000, the remainder is
901,470,000, which expresses the number of miles from the earth at
which we are supposed to view Saturn with such an instrument.</p></div>

from the star or planet’s right ascension, and the remainder is the approximate

 The late Mr. Benjamin Martin, when describing the nature of
the solar telescope, in his ‘<i>Philosophia Britannica</i>,’ Vol. iii. p. 85, gives
the following relation:&mdash;‘I cannot here omit to mention a very <i>unusual
phenomenon</i> that I observed about ten years ago in my darkened room.
The window looked towards the west, and the spire of Chichester
Cathedral was before it at the distance of 50 or 60 yards. I used
very often to divert myself by observing the pleasant manner in which
the sun passed behind the spire, and was eclipsed by it for sometime;
for the image of the sun and of the spire were very large, being made
by a lens of 12 feet focal distance. And once as I observed the occultation
of the sun behind the spire, just as the disk disappeared, I
saw several small, bright, round bodies or balls running toward the
sun from the dark part of the room, even to the distance of 20 inches.
I observed their motion was a little irregular, but rectilinear, and
seemed accelerated as they approached the sun. These luminous
globules appeared also on the other side of the spire, and preceded
the sun, running out into the dark room, sometimes more, sometimes
less, together in the same manner as they followed the sun at its occultation.
They appeared to be in general one-twentieth of an inch in
diameter, and therefore, must be very large luminous globes in some
part of the heavens, whose light was extinguished by that of the sun,
so that they appeared not in open day light; but whether of the
meteor kind, or what sort of bodies they might be, I could not conjecture.’
Professor Hansteen mentions, that when employed in measuring
the zenith distances of the pole star, he observed a somewhat
similar phenomenon, which he described as ‘a luminous body which
passed over the field of the universal telescope&mdash;that its motion was
neither perfectly equal nor rectilinear, but resembled very much the
unequal and somewhat serpentine motion of an ascending rocket;’
and he concluded that it must have been ‘a meteor’ or ‘shooting star’
descending from the higher regions of the atmosphere.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>In my frequent observations on Venus, to determine the nearest
positions to the sun in which that planet could be seen, I had several
times an opportunity of witnessing similar phenomena. I was not a
little surprised, when searching for the planet, frequently to perceive
a body pass across the field of the telescope, apparently of the same
size as Venus, though sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, so that
I frequently mistook that body for the planet, till its rapid motion
undeceived me. In several instances <i>four</i> or <i>five</i> of these bodies appeared
to cross the field of view, sometimes in a perpendicular, and,
at other times in a horizontal direction. They appeared to be luminous
bodies, somewhat resembling the appearance of a planet when
viewed in the day-time with a moderate magnifying power. Their
motion was nearly rectilinear, but sometimes inclined to a waving or
serpentine form, and they appeared to move with considerable rapidity&mdash;the
telescope being furnished with a power of about 70 times. I was
for a considerable time at a loss what opinion to form of the nature of
these bodies; but having occasion to continue these observations
almost every clear day for nearly a twelvemonth, I had frequent opportunities
of viewing this phenomenon in different aspects; and was
at length enabled to form an opinion as to the cause of at least <i>some</i>
of the appearances which presented themselves. In several instances,
the bodies alluded to appeared much larger than usual, and to move
with a more rapid velocity; in which case I could plainly perceive
that they were nothing else than <i>birds</i> of different sizes, and apparently
at different distances, the convex surfaces of whose bodies, in
certain positions, strongly reflected the solar rays. In other instances,
when they appeared smaller, their true shape was undistinguishable
by reason of their motion and their distance.</p>

<p>Having inserted a few remarks on this subject, in No. XXV. of the
Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for July, 1825, particularly in reference
to Professor Hansteen’s opinion, that article came under the
review of M. Serres, Sub-Prefect of Embrun, in a paper inserted in
the <i>Annales de Chemie</i>, for October, 1825, entitled, ‘Notices regarding
fiery meteors seen during the day.’<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> In the discussion of this subject,
M. Serres admits that the light reflected very obliquely from the
feathers of a bird is capable of producing an effect similar to that
which I have now described; but that ‘the explanation ought not to
be <i>generalized</i>.’ He remarks, that, while observing the sun at the repeating
circle, he frequently perceived, even through the coloured
glass adapted to the eye-piece, large luminous points which traversed
the field of the telescope, and which appeared too well defined not to
admit them to be distant, and subtended too large angles to imagine
them birds. In illustration of this subject he states the following
facts. On the 7th September, 1820, after having observed for some
time the eclipse of the sun which happened on that day, he intended
to take a walk in the fields, and on crossing the town, he saw a numerous
group of individuals of every age and sex, who had their eyes
fixed in the direction of the sun. Further on, he perceived another
group having their eyes in like manner turned towards the sun. He
questioned an intelligent artist who was among them to learn the object
that fixed his attention. He replied, ‘We are looking at the
stars which are detaching themselves from the sun.’ ‘You may look
yourself; that will be the shortest way to learn the fact.’ He looked,
and saw, in fact, not stars, but balls of fire of a diameter equal to the
largest stars, which were projected in various directions from the upper
hemisphere of the sun, with an incalculable velocity, and although
this velocity of projection appeared the same in all, yet they did not
all attain the same distance. These globes were projected at unequal
and pretty short intervals. Several were often projected at once, but
always diverging from one another. Some of them described a right
line, and were extinguished in the distance; some described a parabolic
line, and were in like manner extinguished; others again, after
having removed to a certain distance in a right line, retrograded upon
the same line, and seemed to enter, still luminous, into the sun’s disk.
The ground of this magnificent picture was a sky blue, somewhat
tinged with brown. Such was his astonishment at the sight of so
majestic a spectacle, that it was impossible for him to keep his eyes off
it till it ceased, which happened gradually as the eclipse wore off and
the solar rays resumed their ordinary lustre. It was remarked by one
of the crowd that ‘the sun projected most stars at the time when it
was palest;’ and that the circumstance which first excited attention
to this phenomenon was that of a woman who cried out ‘Come here!&mdash;come
and see the flames that are issuing from the sun!’</p>

<p>I have stated the above facts because they may afterwards tend to
throw light upon certain objects or phenomena with which we are at
present unacquainted. The phenomenon of ‘falling stars’ has of late
years excited considerable attention, and it seems now to be admitted,
that, at least, certain species of these bodies descend from regions far
beyond the limits of our atmosphere. This may be pronounced as
certain with regard to the ‘November Meteors.’ May not some of
the phenomena described above, be connected with the fall of meteoric
stones&mdash;the showers of falling stars seen on the 12th and 13th of
November, or other meteoric phenomena whose causes we have hitherto
been unable to explain? Or, may we conceive that certain celestial
bodies, with whose nature and destination we are as yet unacquainted,
may be revolving in different courses in the regions around us&mdash;some
of them opaque and others luminous, and whose light is undistinguishable
by reason of the solar effulgence?</p></div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
